            "context": "The inventories of the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in our review totaled 2,823 aircraft and required approximately $20 billion to operate and support in fiscal year 2016. The inventory, aircraft status, initial operational capability, and service life forecast for each of the 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft are shown in figure 1. Sustainment of fixed-wing aircraft and other weapon systems comprises the logistics and personnel services required to maintain and prolong operations, and DOD policy provides direction to service components on sustainment planning across the life cycle of the weapon system. Specifically, DOD policy requires the services to develop and implement a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, for sustaining its weapon systems. According to DOD\u2019s policy, this strategy should be the basis for all sustainment efforts, including sustainment metrics mapped to key performance parameters and key system attributes, such as aircraft availability, to manage sustainment performance. The policy states that, after initial operating capability, programs should update the sustainment plan whenever there are major changes to its strategy for sustaining the weapon system, or every 5 years, whichever occurs first. The Air Force and the Navy also have guidance that implements the requirements of the DOD guidance. These services\u2019 guidance include sustainment-planning requirements for life-cycle sustainment and assurance of affordability. There are a variety of DOD offices that have roles and responsibilities related to sustaining fixed-wing aircraft. For instance, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD ), is the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense for all matters concerning acquisition and sustainment. Specifically, USD (A&S) is responsible for establishing policies for logistics, maintenance, and sustainment support for all elements of DOD, including fixed-wing aircraft. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness (ASD ) serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the USD (A&S) on logistics and materiel readiness within DOD. Specifically, the ASD (L&MR) is responsible for (1) establishing DOD policies and procedures for logistics, maintenance, materiel readiness, strategic mobility, and sustainment support; (2) providing related guidance to the Secretaries of the military departments, including developing the Life- cycle Sustainment Plan outline; and (3) monitoring and reviewing programs associated with these areas, among other duties and responsibilities. For the Air Force, the Air Force Materiel Command develops, acquires, and sustains weapon systems through research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, maintenance, and program management of the systems and their components. This command provides acquisition and life-cycle management services and logistics support, among other things. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center within the Air Force Materiel Command is responsible for the life-cycle management of weapon systems from inception to retirement. A Program Executive Officer\u2014responsible for managing a specific portfolio of weapon systems\u2014is responsible for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft. The Program Executive Officer oversees the program office that manages each weapon system. For the Navy and Marine Corps, the Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for providing the full life-cycle support of naval aviation aircraft, weapons, and systems. This support includes research, design, development and systems engineering; acquisition; test and evaluation; training facilities and equipment; repair and modification; and in-service engineering and logistics support. As with the Air Force, Program Executive Officers oversee their assigned program managers. DOD relies on program managers to lead the development, delivery, and sustainment of individual weapon systems through their life cycles. The program managers are the designated individuals with responsibility for and authority to accomplish the program\u2019s sustainment objectives to meet the users\u2019 operational needs. Product support managers, who work within the program offices, are responsible for developing and implementing support strategies for weapon systems that maintain readiness and control life-cycle costs. Weapon systems are sustained under various arrangements that may include contractors, DOD organic facilities, or some combination of the two. For example, the Air Force Sustainment Center provides depot maintenance through its Air Logistics Complexes for weapon systems. Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for the Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, which provide depot-level maintenance for Navy and Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, the Air Force Sustainment Center and the Navy Supply Systems Command, as well as the Defense Logistics Agency, manage inventories of repair parts, and individual weapon systems programs are typically supported by a complex supplier network that includes a prime contractor, subcontractors, and various tiers of parts suppliers. On the other hand, sustainment responsibilities\u2014in their entirety or particular elements\u2014may be contracted out as part of a public-private partnership or a performance-based logistics agreement, such as with the F-22 Raptor. The Air Force and Navy monitor the readiness status of selected fixed- wing aircraft through numerous performance metrics. Specifically, the Air Force measures how well a fleet is performing by calculating the availability of the fleets\u2019 aircraft, which is the number of aircraft that are available for flight operations. The Navy measures its aircraft availability through two metrics: (1) Ready-Basic-Aircraft (RBA)\u2014the number of aircraft that are able to safely fly\u2014and (2) Ready-for-Tasking (RFT)\u2014the number of aircraft that are able to conduct specific missions. Both the Air Force and Navy have established goals associated with aircraft availability. In addition to measuring the availability of the aircraft against the associated goals, the Air Force and Navy track the reasons for aircraft not being available or able to conduct missions. Specifically, the Air Force and Navy track the following: Aircraft in depot: Aircraft unavailable to conduct missions because of scheduled or unscheduled depot maintenance or modification. Not mission capable maintenance: Aircraft that are not in depot and not capable of performing any of their assigned missions because of maintenance. Not mission capable supply: Aircraft that are not in depot and not capable of performing any of their assigned missions because of the lack of a repair part. In addition to these three metrics, the Air Force also tracks the following: Not mission capable for both supply and maintenance: Aircraft that are not in depot and not capable of performing any of their assigned missions because of both maintenance and the lack of a repair part. Units possessed not reported: Aircraft that are not available for use for reasons other than depot and not mission capable status, but possessed by the squadron. There are various costs associated with operating and supporting weapon systems. DOD\u2019s Operating and Support Cost-Estimating Guide provides direction to the service components on developing estimates to support various analyses and reviews throughout the program life cycle. According to the guide, as a program matures, it remains necessary to continue to track and assess O&S costs and trends to ensure that the program remains sustainable, affordable, and properly funded. Each military department maintains a database that collects historical data on the O&S costs for major fielded weapon systems. DOD\u2019s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation provides policy guidance on this requirement, known as the Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs program; specifies the common format in which the data are to be reported; and monitors its implementation by each of the military departments. O&S costs are categorized using the following six overarching elements: unit level manpower\u2014cost of operators, maintainers, and other support manpower assigned to operating units; unit operations\u2014cost of unit operating materiel such as fuel, and training material, unit support services, and unit travel; maintenance\u2014cost of system maintenance including depot- and sustaining support\u2014cost of system support activities that are provided by organizations other than the system\u2019s operating units; continuing system improvements\u2014cost of system hardware and software modifications; and indirect support\u2014cost of activities that provide general services that lack the visibility of actual support to specific force units or systems. For the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in our review, aircraft availability and O&S cost trends varied over the 6-year period between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, and the aircraft generally did not meet availability goals. We found that 6 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft\u20143 from each service\u2014experienced decreased aircraft availability between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. One aircraft met availability goals each year between fiscal year 2011 and 2016. Conversely, six aircraft met the goals in some years but not others, and five aircraft did not meet the goals in any year. In the latest year included in our review\u2014fiscal year 2016\u20149 of 12 of the fixed-wing aircraft did not meet their associated availability goals. With respect to O&S costs, the overall O&S total for all 12 aircraft was about $20 billion annually over the 6-year period; some aircraft experienced increases while the costs to operate and support others decreased. The reasons for changes in costs included increases in maintenance costs for 8 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft. Below we summarize these trends, and the \u201cSustainment Quick Looks\u201d in appendices II\u2013XIII provide detailed information on the trends associated with each of the 12 fixed-wing aircraft and appendix XV provides additional information on operating and support cost per aircraft. Our analysis found that: between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, aircraft availability for two of five selected Air Force fixed-wing aircraft fluctuated and for three decreased; between fiscal 2011 and 2016, two aircraft met availability goals in some years, and three aircraft did not meet availability goals in any of the years; and in fiscal year 2016, four of the five aircraft did not meet availability goals. Specific details regarding aircraft availability and not mission capable status for maintenance, supply, and both maintenance and supply were omitted because DOD deemed this information as sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). According to officials, when aircraft availability goals are not met, training and operational missions may not be fulfilled as timely as needed. For example, F-22 squadron officials explained that the lack of available aircraft creates a shortage of trained pilots. F-22 pilots need extensive training to fulfill their air-superiority role. Further, command officials explained that when aircraft availability goals are not met, there may not be enough aircraft to respond to contingency requirements. Officials expressed concern that, given the capability and expectation of the F-22 to be available to create air superiority in any operation, missions may not be met. Additionally, E-8C program office officials stated that missions are often limited to top priority, which means supported combatant commands may not obtain all needed capabilities, such as the E-8C not being able to provide surveillance capability to particular combatant commands. From fiscal years 2011 through 2016, O&S costs for the Air Force aircraft in our review totaled about $13 billion annually. These costs decreased for the C-17, F-16, and the F-22, but increased for the B-52 and E-8C, as shown in figure 2. For example, the F-16\u2019s total annual O&S costs decreased by about $943 million (or about 19 percent) because of decreases in all cost elements\u2014the largest decrease being unit operations\u2014except sustaining support. According to officials, the decrease in unit operations can be attributed to the retiring of aircraft and the consolidation of squadrons. The C-17\u2019s and F-22\u2019s O&S costs decreased mainly because of decreases in two cost elements: continuing system improvements and unit operations. In contrast, the B-52\u2019s and the E-8C\u2019s O&S costs increased, by $76 million (or about 6 percent) and $41 million (or about 6 percent), respectively. The increases occurred because two of the cost elements\u2014continuing system improvements and maintenance costs\u2014increased more than the other costs elements decreased. Based on our analysis of the O&S cost elements, maintenance cost generally is one of the largest portions\u2014on average about 36 percent\u2014of total O&S costs for each aircraft. As shown in figure 3, maintenance costs for four of the five aircraft generally have increased from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. Specifically, maintenance costs for the C-17, E-8C, and F- 22 increased because of additional depot maintenance needs. B-52 maintenance costs fluctuated year to year, but increased overall during this period. The overall maintenance costs for the F-16 decreased by approximately $140 million. According to our analysis, even though there was an increase in some of the F-16 maintenance cost elements, the fleet\u2019s executed flying hours decreased. Therefore, the flying hour depot- level reparable costs decreased by approximately $123 million and engine repair decreased by $115 million, causing the overall maintenance cost to decrease. Our analysis found that: between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, aircraft availability increased for three of the seven Navy fixed-wing aircraft, fluctuated for one, and decreased for the remaining three aircraft; between fiscal 2011 and 2016, one aircraft met aircraft availability goals in each year, and four aircraft met goals in some years, while two aircraft did not meet goals in any of the years; and in fiscal year 2016, the Navy did not meet aircraft availability goals for five of the seven aircraft. Specific details regarding aircraft availability and not mission capable status for maintenance and supply were omitted because DOD deemed this information as sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). To address decreases in aircraft availability, the Navy has moved available aircraft between squadrons to help ensure deploying squadrons are fully equipped for their assigned missions. In November 2017, the Commander of Naval Air Forces testified before the House Armed Services Committee that to equip the air wings with the required number of mission capable aircraft for the deployment of three aircraft carriers in 2017, the Navy had to transfer 94 strike fighters to and from the maintenance depots or between squadrons. This transfer included pulling aircraft from fleet replacement squadrons, where the focus should be on training new aviators. The Commander of Naval Air Forces, in his November 2017 testimony, summarized the issue: \u201cThat strike fighter inventory management, or shell game, leaves non-deployed squadrons well below the number of jets required to keep aviators proficient and progressing toward their career qualifications and milestones, with detrimental impacts to both retention and future experience levels.\u201d Furthermore, based on our analysis, F/A- 18A-D squadrons have underexecuted their flight hours by an average of 4 percent from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. According to officials, this is largely due to low aircraft availability. Additionally, placing further strain on aircraft availability, the F/A-18A-D inventory has decreased from 581 aircraft in fiscal year 2011 to 537 aircraft in fiscal year 2016. From fiscal years 2011 through 2016, O&S costs for the Navy\u2019s seven selected fixed-wing aircraft totaled about $7 billion annually. Also, the Navy has experienced varying O&S and maintenance costs since fiscal year 2011 for these aircraft. Specifically, annual O&S costs decreased for the AV-8B, C-2A, E-2C, and F/A-18A-D, and increased for the E-2D, EA- 18G, and F/A-18E-F, as shown in figure 4. We found that O&S costs for the F/A-18A-D decreased by about 22 percent from about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. According to officials, this decrease can be attributed to the decrease in inventory as aircraft are retired and squadrons transition to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In another example, O&S costs for the E- 2D increased from about $1.6 million in fiscal year 2012 to about $125 million in fiscal year 2016. The size of the fleet has increased by 17 aircraft\u2014from 3 to 20 since fiscal year 2011. According to officials, this aircraft remains in production with a projected fleet size of 75; as inventory increases, so will O&S costs. Based on our analysis of the O&S cost elements, maintenance cost generally is one of the largest portions\u2014about 42 percent\u2014of total O&S costs for the seven aircraft in our review. Annual maintenance costs have increased for the C-2A, E-2D, EA-18G, and F/A-18E-F, and decreased for the AV-8B, E-2C, and F/A-18A-D, as shown in figure 5. We found that maintenance cost for the C-2A increased by about 7 percent from about $89 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $95 million in fiscal year 2016. According to officials, the increase in maintenance cost can be attributed to increased demand for outer wing panels, which resulted in a $16 million increase in depot-level repair costs and a more than 10 percent increase in executed flight hours, among other things. In another example, maintenance cost for the AV-8B decreased by about 9 percent from about $375 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $341 million in fiscal year 2016. According to officials, these decreases can be attributed to the AV-8B no longer being used in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2012, the loss of six aircraft, and the transition of AV-8B squadrons to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force and Navy face similar sustainment challenges that relate to aging, maintenance, and supply support that affect aircraft availability and O&S costs for the 12 aircraft selected in our review, as shown in figure 6. Specifically, 10 of 12 aircraft are experiencing sustainment challenges related to aging; all 12 are experiencing challenges related to maintenance; and all 12 are also experiencing challenges related to supply support. Below is a brief overview of these challenges: Aging: A number of these aircraft are aging and operating beyond their planned service life, partly because of delays in replacement aircraft. Specifically, the Air Force and Navy plan to replace the F-16, AV-8B, and F/A-18A-D with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Navy is expected to transition the F/A-18A-D through 2030 and the Marine Corps is planning to use the F/A-18A-D beyond 2030 (although these time frames have been extended several times already). The Navy plans to retire the AV-8B in 2026. On the other hand, the Air Force is not expected to retire the F-16 until at least 2040. Because of aging, according to officials, there are parts on some aircraft that need to be repaired and replaced that were not accounted for during initial sustainment analysis. To mitigate some challenges associated with the age of the fixed-wing aircraft, the Air Force and Navy program officials have decided to extend the service life of some aircraft by repairing and overhauling airframes and components, as well as developing the engineering specifications for parts that were never planned to be repaired or replaced. Maintenance: Delays in getting aircraft into and through depot maintenance, as well as shortages of skilled maintainers, are contributing to some aircraft missing their availability goals. Both services reported losing experienced maintainers, either to retirement or to other programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. To address maintenance challenges, program offices for the selected aircraft have improved the efficiency and speed of depot maintenance, as well as are working to ensure there are sufficient numbers of trained maintainers. Supply Support: Some aircraft are encountering supply shortages as a result of parts not being available, in some cases due to obsolescence issues or diminishing manufacturer sources. Overcoming part shortages through either searching for replacement parts or reengineering parts takes time, which can contribute to aircraft being unavailable for longer periods. To mitigate supply challenges, officials have proactively upgraded aircraft before obsolescence occurs or located available parts and reengineered parts that are no longer in production, as well as identified suitable manufacturers in advance, among other things. For more specific information on sustainment challenges related to aging aircraft, maintenance, and supply support for each of the fixed-wing aircraft, see the \u201cSustainment Quick Looks\u201d in appendixes II\u2013XIII. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for its five selected aircraft in our review, but the Navy has not documented sustainment strategies or updated the strategies for four of seven of its aircraft in our review. The Air Force and Navy also regularly reviewed sustainment metrics and have implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for the five selected fixed-wing aircraft and updated them in accordance with Air Force guidance. However, the Navy has not documented a sustainment strategy or updated the strategies for four of the seven aircraft in our review since 2012. See figure 7 for the year of the most recent update to the sustainment strategy for the aircraft in our review. While sustainment strategies do not guarantee successful outcomes, they serve as a tool to guide operations as well as support planning and implementation of activities through the life-cycle of the aircraft. Specifically, at a high-level the strategy is aimed at integrating requirements, product support elements, funding, and risk management to provide oversight of the aircraft. For example, these sustainment strategies can be documented in a life-cycle sustainment plan, postproduction support plan, or an in-service support plan, among other types of documented strategies. Additionally, program officials stated that an aircraft\u2019s sustainment strategy is an important management tool for the sustainment of the aircraft by documenting requirements that are known by all stakeholders, including good practices identified in sustaining each aircraft. For example: The strategy for the Air Force B-52 has been updated several times in recent years because of several major modifications. For example, in 2014 the Air Force issued an updated sustainment plan within the life- cycle management plan to update the combat network communications technology program because the B-52\u2019s communications system is still the original from the 1950s and has limitations related to making mission or target changes in flight. The plan addresses the testing, resource management, and numerous program performance indicators and requirements of the system. The strategy for the Air Force F-16 outlines plans for the aircraft\u2019s service life extension and includes proactive measures and data forecasting to bundle depot modifications in order to minimize fleet- wide effects on aircraft availability. The service life extension for the F- 16 is designed to extend the service life of 300 F-16 aircraft from 8,000 to 13,856 flight hours at an estimated cost of $740 million (as of June 2016). The strategy for the Navy E-2D provides a systematic approach to ensure that a comprehensive support package is in place to support the sustainment of the aircraft. Also, it describes the overall plan for the management and execution of the product support package by communicating the sustainment strategy to stakeholders in the acquisition, engineering, and logistics communities. However, the Navy had not documented a sustainment strategy for the C- 2A because a strategy was not required when the aircraft, now a legacy system, was going through the acquisition process prior to 1965. According to Navy officials, while they have not documented a strategy for the C-2A, they are undertaking efforts, such as updating technical publications, performing maintenance analysis on the landing gear, and evaluating depot tasks to decrease turnaround time, among other efforts, to sustain the aircraft. However, a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A would help guide the planning and implementation of these efforts, as well as serve as a management tool by documenting these requirements that are known by all stakeholders. In addition, the Navy\u2019s sustainment strategies for the E-2C (2011), EA- 18G (2006), and F/A-18A-D (2001) were developed prior to 2012 and thus have not been updated in over 5 years. With respect to the EA-18G, Navy officials told us that the sustainment strategy should be updated in accordance with DOD\u2019s acquisition policy\u2014DOD Instruction 5000.02\u2014 since the EA-18G is still in the acquisition process, as it continues to be produced. For the E-2C and F/A-18A-D, Naval Air Systems Command officials and program office officials told us that they were not required to document sustainment strategies because these aircraft were legacy systems at the time the requirement to develop and maintain a sustainment strategy was implemented. Therefore, according to these officials, the DOD requirements to document and update sustainment strategies every 5 years in DOD Instruction 5000.02 were not applicable. DOD Instruction 5000.02 requires weapon systems to have some form of a sustainment strategy that is not older than 5 years; however, it is unclear whether this policy is applicable to legacy weapon systems. Specifically, the policy states that program managers for all programs are responsible for developing and maintaining a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, beginning at the risk-reduction decision point (i.e., Milestone A of the acquisition process). However, based on our discussions with Navy program officials for our selected aircraft and our review of the policy, it is unclear whether the policy\u2014as currently written\u2014is applicable to legacy systems that were no longer in production and thus had completed the risk-reduction decision point (or Milestone A) prior to the requirement to update a sustainment strategy every 5 years. According to DOD officials, the intent of the policy is for all programs, including legacy weapon systems, to develop and maintain a sustainment strategy; however, the policy does not explicitly state that legacy systems are expected to fulfill this requirement. In May 2017, the Air Force updated its sustainment guidance to require sustainment strategies for legacy systems and for those strategies to be updated every 5 years. Air Force officials told us that they did this because the DOD policy was unclear whether it was applicable to legacy systems and it was a good practice to ensure the guidance was explicit for all weapon systems to document and update a sustainment strategy. This instruction explicitly states that the requirement to document a sustainment strategy and update it every 5 years is applicable to all weapon systems, including legacy systems that are in the O&S phase of their life cycles. Additionally, the Air Force Instruction states that these legacy systems are not required to retroactively meet requirements identified for previous phases of the acquisition life-cycle, but should meet the requirements needed for continued operations of the system. However, the Navy has not made the requirement explicit for legacy systems in its guidance. Specifically, Navy guidance does not explicitly state that documenting a sustainment strategy and updating that strategy every 5 years is a requirement for legacy systems. While Navy guidance requires the development and use of sustainment metrics for legacy systems and requires the Naval Air Systems Command be responsible for aviation weapon systems in sustainment, the Navy does not address any requirement for sustainment strategies for legacy systems. The lack of clarity in DOD Instruction 5000.02 and the Navy guidance regarding whether legacy systems are required to document a sustainment strategy and update that strategy every 5 years has resulted in confusion regarding sustainment planning requirements among Navy program offices and could cause confusion with other weapon system program offices across DOD. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should define objectives in specific terms so they are understood at all levels of the entity. The standards also state that guidance should clearly define what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement. As indicated by the Air Force\u2019s 2017 update to its sustainment guidance, clarifying DOD and Navy guidance and the applicability of sustainment strategy requirements to legacy systems could be done through very small additions and clarifications to the applicable guidance documents. Until DOD and the Navy update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy systems, weapon system program offices, such as those for fixed-wing aircraft, as well as Naval Air Systems Command and DOD may not have full visibility of necessary requirements to achieve program objectives or any related risks associated with the sustainment of these weapon systems. While the DOD policy and Navy guidance is unclear, Naval Air Systems Command and Navy program offices for the four aircraft\u2014C-2A, E-2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D\u2014that either do not have a sustainment strategy or have not updated the strategy within the last 5 years are taking actions to document or update the sustainment strategies for these aircraft. According to Naval Air Systems Command officials, once it was brought to their attention that the intent of DOD Instruction 5000.02 was for legacy systems to have an updated documented sustainment strategy, they began to take action to develop or update the respective sustainment strategies. Specifically, according to C-2A, E-2C, and E-2D program officials, they are currently updating the E-2D strategy for its 5-year update, which is due in fiscal year 2018, and it will include updates for the C-2A and E-2C since the airframe for all three aircraft are very similar. Also, program officials for the EA-18G and F/A-18A-D told us that they are currently updating the strategies for these aircraft and are expected to complete the process in fiscal year 2018. Given that the Navy is already taking action to update its sustainment strategies and has established timelines for these updates, we are not making any recommendations to the Navy regarding updating the respective sustainment strategies. The Air Force and the Navy have (1) regularly reviewed sustainment metrics for fixed-wing aircraft and (2) implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability. The Air Force and Navy have regularly monitored the condition of their fixed-wing aircraft, which includes measuring aircraft availability against planned goals as well as monitoring other sustainment metrics. Specifically, the Air Force Materiel Command monitors aircraft availability and other sustainment metrics through quarterly Weapon System Enterprise Review (WSER) briefings. The program office in conjunction with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center generates the WSER, which is briefed through Air Force Materiel Command and the Program Executive Offices to the Air Force Chief of Staff. The WSER delivers insight into the comprehensive health of a system by flagging gaps in performance and identifying mitigating actions, which is used to conduct crosscutting enterprise analysis and provide input into readiness reviews. In addition to the WSER, the program offices manage their performance through their Health of the Fleet briefs. These briefs\u2014conducted monthly or quarterly depending upon the aircraft\u2014include readiness assessments that provide insight on maintenance and management practices. The assessment is delivered by the program\u2019s maintenance group, and includes aircraft performance metrics, issues, actions, and schedules to inform program leadership on fleet status and to help prioritize and make decisions concerning the issues. The Navy monitors aircraft availability through its aircraft status dashboard for each aircraft, which provides specific information, such as goals, actual availability, and gaps between the two. More specifically, the Navy tracks the status of each of its aircraft through the dashboard, including those aircraft that are available (i.e., Ready-Basic-Aircraft ), are in depot maintenance, or are not mission capable due to maintenance or supply, among other metrics. The dashboard is updated monthly, and there are weekly meetings with key stakeholders, including Naval Air Systems Command officials, industry partners, and depot officials, to monitor the performance of each aircraft and make adjustments to improve aircraft availability. Additionally, all program offices have processes in place to manage the fleet within their portfolios, including semiannual or annual program reviews such as Program Management Reviews and Executive Steering Reviews. These reviews focus on readiness, cost drivers, and initiatives to address program risk and ways to resolve issues affecting each aircraft. Further, the Marine Corps Commandant for Aviation leads biannual Executive Steering Summits to assess readiness issues affecting Marine Corps aircraft. The Air Force and Navy have implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft. Air Force program offices for the fixed-wing aircraft in our review have plans for improving availability. Since 2005, the Air Force Materiel Command has had an annual process to improve aircraft availability, which is known as the Aircraft Availability Improvement Program. The process enables the program offices to assess and limit risk, incorporate available support funding, and specifically address where there are effects on availability, such as aircraft in depot. This process also incorporates projecting historical and goal rates in order to leverage scheduled and modernization maintenance. Program offices create plans, known as aircraft availability improvement plans, based on these projections to forecast improvements that can facilitate increased availability and reduction of costs, among other things. The Air Force provides guidance in the form of a template to ensure consistency amongst the plans, which typically must include improvement initiatives with milestone goals. This information includes projected aircraft availability rates for mission capable, units possessed not reported, not mission capable for supply, not mission capable for maintenance, and depot possession. Officials noted that the program office creates an improvement plan each year, regardless of whether it is short of its availability goal, since the plan serves as a forecasting measure. The program is designed to ensure the program offices have plans in place to meet target goals, and the information and milestones laid out in the plans feed into the WSER briefings to senior management. For example: The B-52 plan for fiscal year 2017 discusses the process and milestones for replacing actuator seals for the fleet, the costs of the repair, and the expected benefit to B-52 availability\u20141.05 percent improvement to the not mission capable supply metric. The C-17 plan for fiscal year 2017 identifies the current and future modifications, timelines for beginning and completion, and the effect on availability. For example, the future replacement of a legacy computer system with a modernized system and display is set to begin in fiscal year 2019 with an estimated completion date of 2026. This replacement is planned to be done concurrently with other maintenance, and to prevent future declines in the C-17\u2019s availability. The F-22 plan for fiscal year 2017 identifies several projects taking place between 2016 and 2021 that are expected to improve availability by almost 2 percent. Further, officials said they are currently working with the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) to develop an Air Force manual that would make developing an Aircraft Availability Improvement Plan a requirement. This manual will become a supplement to Air Force Instruction 63-101/20-101, according to the officials. Navy program offices for all seven fixed-wing aircraft in our review also have plans for improving availability. According to Navy officials, they started preparing \u201csummary playbooks,\u201d which is the Navy\u2019s term for improvement plans, in late 2015 and started implementing these plans in early 2016 to increase aircraft availability. Officials told us that there was a limitation in funding because of sequestration prior to fiscal year 2017, which hampered their ability to fully implement the playbooks. At a broad level, the Navy\u2019s playbooks include efforts such as maintenance planning, supply support, aircraft material condition and management, and technical data, among other things. These efforts are linked to specific initiatives such as working with the manufacturer and contractors to provide maintenance support, identifying obsolete parts, conducting aircraft fatigue analysis, and updating technical publications, among other things, which have been identified by the program office as ways to improve aircraft availability. Additionally, these playbooks include the extent to which these initiatives are funded, underfunded, or partially funded and the appropriation account that would fund each initiative. The playbooks include the status of each initiative, and some of the playbooks also provide an approximate time frame for implementing each initiative. For example: The playbook for the C-2A has a fatigue analysis initiative focused on analyzing the landing gear to update its design, provide a depot repair manual, and increase its service life, among other things. This initiative is considered funded, is expected to improve aircraft availability, and has an estimated time frame for implementation between fiscal years 2017 and 2021. The playbook for the E-2D contains a maintenance initiative focused on improving the maintenance planning process of the C-2A, E-2C, and E-2D aircraft by completing elements of the product support package, such as training, publications, support equipment, and tools, among others. This initiative is considered partially funded, is expected to improve aircraft availability by decreasing the not mission- capable rates related to maintenance and supply and decreasing maintenance down time, and has an estimated time frame for implementation between fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The playbook for the F/A-18A-D includes a product improvement initiative to conduct a case study to assess the condition of the wiring of the aircraft in the fleet. This initiative is considered funded and is expected to help to sustain aircraft availability. However, there is no time frame for implementing this initiative. The playbook for the F/A-18E-F contains a service life modification initiative focused on extending the service life of the aircraft through modifications. According to officials, this initiative is considered partially funded, is expected to help to sustain aircraft availability, and is expected to help the fleet realize an 80 percent cost avoidance because the Navy will not have to pay the cost to replace these aircraft. Also, this initiative has an estimated time frame for implementation between fiscal years 2018 through 2040. The Departments of the Air Force and Navy spend tens of billions of dollars each year to sustain their fixed-wing aircraft, which need expensive logistics support, including maintenance and repair, to meet goals for availability. The departments spent at least $20 billion annually since 2011 to sustain the 12 aircraft that we examined. The Air Force and Navy share a variety of sustainment challenges, including the age of their aircraft as well as maintenance and supply support issues. These challenges have led to half (6 of 12) of the aircraft in our review experiencing decreasing availability and to the aircraft in general not being able to meet aircraft availability goals. For example, 9 of 12 aircraft did not meet availability goals in fiscal year 2016. These trends are occurring even though the Air Force and Navy regularly review sustainment metrics for the aircraft and are implementing plans for improving aircraft availability. However, DOD\u2019s policy and the Navy\u2019s guidance are not clear on whether the services should have a current sustainment strategy for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and on whether the strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. Without clarity about whether the DOD instruction and the Navy guidance apply to legacy systems, program officials will not know whether they are required to have a sustainment strategy or are required to update the plan for their respective fixed-wing aircraft. Furthermore, the program offices, the services, and DOD may not have full visibility of necessary requirements to document program objectives, related risks, and the effectiveness of the program, ultimately jeopardizing the sustainability and affordability of each of the programs. We are making the following two recommendations to DOD: The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of the Navy should update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of the sensitive report to DOD for review and comment. In written comments that are reproduced in appendix XVI, DOD concurred with our recommendations and noted planned actions to address each recommendation. The Air Force and Navy also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; and the Director, Defense Logistics Agency. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have questions about this report, please contact me at merrittz@gao.gov or (202) 512-5257. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix XVII. Over the past several years, we have conducted work on a number of issues that affect the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to sustain its weapon systems. In September 2017, we found that several factors were important to the success of Product Support Managers. These factors included teamwork and collaboration, early implementation of the Product Support Manager position, and organizational support and emphasis on sustainment. We also found that in response to our 2014 recommendations regarding the implementation of the Product Support Manager position, DOD had developed a comprehensive career path and associated guidance to develop, train, and support future Product Support Managers. Additionally, DOD revised guidance to define roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships between support staff and Product Support Managers. However, DOD was still in the process of implementing our other three recommendations, such as issuing clear, comprehensive, centralized guidance regarding the roles and responsibilities of PSMs and collecting and evaluating information on the effects, if any, that Product Support Managers are having on life-cycle sustainment decisions for their assigned weapon systems. In September 2017, we also found that DOD does not have complete information to identify and manage single-source-of-supply risks. Specifically, some parts are provided by a single source of supply (e.g., one manufacturing facility), and if that single source were no longer able to provide the part, DOD could face challenges in maintaining weapon systems. DOD concurred with our six recommendations focused on improving the completeness of information for single-source-of-supply risks, including issuing department-wide policy that clearly defines requirements of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages management, and details responsibilities and procedures to be followed to implement the policy. DOD is in the process of taking action to implement these recommendations. In June 2016, we found that the Defense Logistics Agency and the military services have not adopted metrics to measure the accuracy of planning factors, such as the accuracy of part lists, or the costs created by backorders. As a result, depot maintenance may not be efficient or cost-effective, resulting in unnecessary delays in the repair of weapon systems. DOD concurred with our six recommendations to develop metrics to monitor the accuracy of demand planning factors and disruption costs created by the lack of parts at depot maintenance sites and is in the process of taking action to implement these recommendations. For a listing of relevant past GAO work, see the Related GAO Products list at the end of this report. Sustainment: Depot maintenance conducted organically at the designated air logistics complex and contractually for some depot- level repairs at contractor facilities. The B-52 is a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions, including strategic attack, close air support, air interdiction, maritime operations, and offensive counter-air missions. It can carry nuclear or precision-guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability. However, the B-52s are some of the oldest aircraft in the Air Force\u2019s fleet, and will continue to operate until at least 2040 (see fig. 8). Operating and support (O&S) costs for the B-52s have remained relatively steady, generally fluctuating around $1.2 billion\u2013$1.3 billion per year. As a predominantly military-maintained system, most of that O&S cost is related to maintenance and manpower, with depot maintenance and depot-level reparables\u2014direct labor and materials for item repairs, transportation, and storage, among other things\u2014accounting for most of the maintenance cost. Technology Program (2014) is focused on upgrading outdated communications technology. The communications modification requires 7,000 hours of work and is estimated to be complete by 2020. The fleet has active sustainment plans for other components of the aircraft, such as the B-52 Anti-skid Replacement Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (2015), which is estimated to cost over $40 million and be completed by 2019. The B-52 faces sustainment challenges related to its age and, according to officials, replacement parts are difficult to obtain. Several modernization efforts are under way (communications, engines, etc.), and is working with vendors and its own service engineers to identify problem areas and plan ahead so that replacement parts will be available. Depot maintenance on the B-52 is managed by the program office and conducted at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex depot. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The C-17 is a long-range, heavy logistic transport aircraft powered by four F-117 turbofan engines with air-refueling capability that was first manufactured in 1987 (see fig. 10). It is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or to bases in any forward deployment area. The C-17 can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can transport ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations, when required. The C-17 can carry virtually all air-transportable equipment. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the C-17 have decreased from about $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011 to about $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit operations decreased, while maintenance costs have generally increased during this period due to contractor logistics support because the C-17 is a predominantly contractor-managed aircraft. The C-17 Enterprise Life Cycle Management Plan and Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (2014) documents current and future acquisition, sustainment, and integration efforts of the aircraft. It also addresses contractual arrangements and partnership support agreements between Air Force, Boeing, and other service providers for aircraft sustainment. Boeing provides continued sole-source life-cycle support for the C-17 under the terms of the Globemaster Integrated Sustainment Program (2013). Under this program, Boeing is responsible for sustainment, to include material management and depot maintenance support. The C-17 participates in a virtual fleet arrangement, a global network of 43 additional C-17 aircraft, which allows participants total aircraft parts access from any fleet participant worldwide. The C-17 is an aircraft being modified to meet its requirements as well as to address maintenance and supply issues. The Air Force\u2019s actions to mitigate these challenges include processes to increase the service life of the aircraft, allowing managers to quickly hire skilled workers for critical positions, and locating other vendor source for parts. Logistics Complex, and at its facility in San Antonio; landing gear overhaul occurs at Ogden Air Logistics Complex, and engine overhaul occurs at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex in partnership with Pratt & Whitney, the original equipment manufacturer on the F-117 turbofan engine. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Sustainment: Depot maintenance conducted by Northrop Grumman, and field maintenance conducted organically, by the National Guard. The E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8C) was first manufactured in 1967 (see fig. 12). Its primary mission is to provide theater ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption, and destruction of enemy forces. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the E-8C have generally increased from about $686 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $734 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, maintenance cost has increased partly because of increases in contractor logistics support since the E-8C is maintained by Northrop Grumman. E-8C aircraft were formerly used as commercial airliners and purchased by the Air Force. Therefore, the exact usage of the aircraft was unknown with any degree of specificity. The program office has utilized new analysis conducted by Boeing to develop an improved method of determining and tracking service life for the E-8C aircraft. The new method uses a quantitative analysis capability to identify safety of flight structural concerns, allowing for planning and execution of risk mitigation. The E-8C is an aircraft with significant maintenance and supply issues according to Air Force officials. The Air Force\u2019s actions to mitigate these challenges include updating the Maintenance Plan and the Corrosion Plan for the E-8C (formerly a commercial airframe) to bring them in line with military standards. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Sustainment: Depot maintenance conducted organically at the designated air logistics complex, and field maintenance conducted organically and by contractors. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a compact, single-engine, multirole fighter aircraft first manufactured in 1978 (see figure 14). It is highly maneuverable and participates in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. There are four versions of the F-16: A, single-seat model; B, two-seat model with tandem cockpits; C and D, single- and two-seat models, respectively, incorporating newer capabilities. Total operating and support (O&S) cost for the F-16 decreased from about $5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $4 billion in fiscal year 2016 because of a 6 percent reduction of inventory. Specifically, maintenance cost has generally decreased during this same period as a result of a decrease in cost of depot maintenance. Sustainment: Performance-based logistics contract with depot maintenance subcontracted to Ogden Air Logistics Complex, Utah, and field maintenance performed organically. and is designed to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances, and defeat threats. Overall operating and support costs (O&S) for the F-22 have decreased about $248 million overall since fiscal year 2011. Maintenance issues continue to be an area of concern for the aircraft, and these costs increased approximately $255 million from fiscal years 2011 to 2016, due to increases in contractor logistics costs. maintaining a comprehensive diminishing manufacturing sources program and proactively supporting the continued sustainment of component parts of the aircraft through various replacement programs, such as the F-22 Reliability and Maintainability Maturation. This initiative is an ongoing effort to drive continuous improvement in availability. The F-22 faces issues with its low- observable coating and supply funding. Actions to mitigate these challenges include contracting a repair facility to conduct coating reversion repair and securing additional spares funding. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The AV-8B Harrier (AV-8B) is a Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing attack aircraft first manufactured in 1984 (see fig. 18). The AV-8B has the capability of conducting close air support using conventional weapons for intermediate range intercept and attack missions. The AV-8B is capable of deploying and operating on aircraft carriers and other suitable seagoing platforms, advanced bases, expeditionary airfields, and remote tactical landing sites. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the AV-8B have decreased from about $815 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $646 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit-level manpower and operations as well as maintenance costs have decreased partly because the inventory is decreasing as AV-8B squadrons transition to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Average number of flying hours: 4,711 hours per aircraft Operating and support cost: $646 million Depot maintenance activity and squadron locations: AV-8B Program Strategic Sustainment and Warfighting Relevance Plan (2013) addresses strategic sustainment and warfighting requirements to ensure relevance, reliability, safety, and sustainability through five pillars: recruit and retain high-quality people, develop a comprehensive readiness and sustainment plan, meet combatant commander requirements, retain and sustain government and industry agencies to support engineering and logistics requirements, and integrate capabilities to remain tactically relevant and operationally effective. AV-8B is maintained organically at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under planned maintenance intervals occurring every 1,500 flight hours; supply support is provided organically by Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency; contractor support services are provided by Boeing. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Manufacturer: Grumman Corporation (acquired by Northrop Grumman) The C-2A Greyhound Logistics Aircraft (C-2A) is a high-wing, twin-engine monoplane cargo aircraft first manufactured in 1965 (see fig. 20). It is designed to land on aircraft carriers, with a primary mission of providing critical logistics support to Carrier Strike Groups by transporting high-priority cargo, mail, and passengers between carriers and shore bases. The original C-2A aircraft were overhauled to extend their operational life in 1973 and again from 2004 through 2011. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the C-2A have generally decreased from about $233 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $207 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit-level manpower, unit operations, and continuing system improvements have decreased, while maintenance costs have increased. landing gear, and avionics system, among others. The Navy will include an appendix for the C-2A when it updates the sustainment strategy for the E 2D for its 5-year update. C-2A completed a service life extension program from 2004 through 2011 to increase flight hours from 10,000 to 15,000 and landings from 16,020 to 36,000, among other things. Aircraft are maintained organically by field maintainers and at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under a planned maintenance interval cycle with three planned maintenance interval events occurring consecutively every 24 months, and supply support is provided organically by the Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The E-2 Hawkeye (E-2C) is the Navy\u2019s all-weather, carrier-based tactical battle management, surface surveillance coordination and airborne early warning, command and control aircraft, with a planned sunset in 2026 when the last E-2D is delivered (see fig. 22). The E-2 is a twin-engine, five- crewmember, high-wing turboprop aircraft with a 24-foot diameter radar rotodome attached to the upper fuselage. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the E-2 have decreased from about $536 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $345 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower and maintenance costs have decreased, partly because E-2C inventory is decreasing as E-2C squadrons transition to the E-2D fleet. comprehensive sustainment logistics, engineering programs, and financial resources necessary to ensure continued platform sustainment and attainment of readiness and safety operations. The Navy will include an appendix for the E-2C when it updates the sustainment strategy for the E-2D for its 5-year update. E-2C is maintained organically by field maintainers and at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under a planned maintenance interval cycle: initial planned maintenance interval is performed by field maintainers at 42 months and the second cycle is performed at a Fleet Readiness Center 46 months after the initial planned maintenance interval. Supply support is provided organically by the Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency; contractor support services are provided by General Dynamics and Wyle Labs. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The E-2 Advanced Hawkeye (E-2D) is the newest variant of the E-2 aircraft platform, expecting to reach full operational capability by 2027 (see fig. 24). Using the same configuration as the E-2C, the E-2D aircraft is used for surface-surveillance coordination and airborne early warning, and command control. Its mission is to provide advanced warning of approaching enemy surface units, and cruise missiles and aircraft, among other things. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the E-2D have increased consistently since fiscal year 2011 to about $125 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase is driven by the addition of aircraft to the inventory as the Navy continues to produce E-2D aircraft through 2026. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The EA-18G Growler is the fourth major variant of the F/A-18 family of aircraft manufactured in 2007 to replace the EA-6B Prowler (see fig. 26). The EA-18G is the first newly designed electronic warfare aircraft produced in more than 35 years and combines the proven F/A-18 Super Hornet platform with a sophisticated electronic warfare suite. Total O&S costs for the EA-18G have consistently increased from about $334 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $868 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower and maintenance costs have increased partly because the inventory is increasing, as EA-18Gs are still in production. design, development, and fielding of the aircraft. Some of the key support program elements include developing support equipment and technical data, testing requirements for avionics, and facilities requirements, among others. The Navy is updating this plan and expects to finalize it in 2018. The aircraft are maintained organically at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under planned maintenance intervals, which typically occur every 72 months. Also, the Navy partners with Boeing to provide wholesale supply and depot repair support for major components, such as the engine. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The F/A-18A-D Hornet Strike Fighter is a twin-engine, mid-wing, multimission tactical aircraft initially fielded in the 1980s (see fig. 28). In its fighter mode, it is used primarily as a fighter escort and for air defense; in its attack mode, it is used for force projection, interdiction, and air support. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the F/A-18A-D have decreased consistently from about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower, operations, and maintenance costs have decreased, partly because the F/A-18A-Ds are being permanently transitioned out of service to be replaced by the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.. and financial resources necessary to ensure continued readiness and supportability for the remainder of the aircraft\u2019s service life. The Navy is currently updating this plan and expects to finalize it in 2018. The aircraft are maintained organically at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under planned maintenance intervals, which typically occur every 48 months for carrier-deploying aircraft, and every 72 months for land-based aircraft. The Navy implemented the High-Flight-Hour program in 2006 to extend the service life from 8,000 to 10,000 flight hours by inspecting and repairing airframes, and replacing major components and parts. The High-Flight-Hour program, along with other factors, has led to maintenance carryover (i.e., into the next fiscal year) due to maintenance events taking longer than planned. In 1999, the Navy entered into a contract with Boeing for engineering support to leverage resources within the technology and industrial base to improve efficiency of the maintenance process and address the maintenance backlog. The F/A-18A-D is operating beyond its planned service life with maintenance and supply issues. The Navy\u2019s actions to mitigate these challenges include extending the service life of the aircraft, allowing maintainers to work overtime to reduce backlog, and cannibalizing parts\u2014moving parts from one aircraft to another. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The F/A-18E-F Super Hornet was first manufactured in 1998 (see fig. 30). The F/A-18E-F is highly capable across the full mission spectrum: air superiority, fighter escort, reconnaissance, aerial refueling, close air support, air defense suppression, and day/night precision strike. The F/A-18E-F provides aircrew the capability and performance necessary to face 21st century threats. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the F/A-18E-4 have increased from about $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower, maintenance, and continuing system support have increased, partly because the inventory is increasing, as the F/A-18E-F is still in production. the Navy is conducting an assessment to determine the number of flight hours the aircraft can safely continue to fly, and then extend the service life of the program through inspections, repairs, and modifications, among other things. The Navy contracted with Boeing to potentially begin these efforts by fiscal year 2018. The F/A-18E-F is a high operational tempo aircraft supporting contingency operations with maintenance and supply issues. The Navy\u2019s actions to mitigate these challenges include plans to extend the service life of the aircraft, training maintainers to transition to vacated positions, and cannibalizing parts\u2014removing parts from one aircraft to another. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. To examine the trends in aircraft availability and operating and support (O&S) costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, including whether the aircraft met availability goals, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft managed by the Departments of the Air Force and the Navy. These included two Marine Corps aircraft that are managed by the Department of the Navy. This nongeneralizable sample was selected to ensure a mix of aircraft, including type of aircraft (fighter, bomber, cargo, etc.), age of the aircraft, and size of inventory, and whether the aircraft were sustained organically by the Department of Defense (DOD) or through contract arrangements, such as public-private partnerships or performance-based logistics, among other factors. For the Air Force, we selected five fixed-wing aircraft\u2014the B-52 Stratofortress, C-17 Globemaster III, E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F-22 Raptor. For the Navy, including the Marine Corps, we selected seven fixed-wing aircraft\u2014the AV-8B Harrier, C-2A Greyhound Logistics Aircraft, E-2 Hawkeye Early Warning and Control Aircraft, E-2 Advanced Hawkeye Early Warning and Control Aircraft, EA-18G Growler, F/A-18 Hornet Strike Fighter A-D, and F/A-18 Super Hornet E-F. The Marine Corps uses the AV-8B Harrier and also uses a variant of the F/A-18A-D. For the selected aircraft, we obtained and reviewed the aircraft availability, sustainment, and O&S data for accuracy and completeness, interviewed officials regarding their data-collection processes, and reviewed available related policies and procedures associated with the collection of the data. As a result, we found the information to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting sustainment metrics, such as aircraft availability and O&S costs. status due to maintenance, supply, and both. With respect to O&S costs, we collected and analyzed data from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. We conducted data-reliability assessments for the data provided by the Air Force and the Navy. To do this, we sent data-reliability questionnaires to both departments requesting information on the sources that generated the data. For the Air Force, we conducted data-reliability assessments on the Air Force Total Ownership Cost system and the Logistics Installation and Mission Support system. For the Navy, we conducted data-reliability assessments on the Aviation Management Supply and Readiness Reporting\u2014Type Model Series Integrated Database, the Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation system, the Flying Hour Projection System / Cost Adjustment and Visibility Tracking System, and the Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs system. We reviewed responses from both departments on these sources as well as documentation\u2014such as guidance, user manuals, and data dictionaries\u2014provided to corroborate questionnaire responses, and interviewed knowledgeable officials to discuss the data. We concluded that the data provided by the Air Force and the Navy were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting condition metrics such as aircraft availability; not mission capable status due to maintenance, supply, and both; depot inductions; budgeted and executed flight hours; and O&S costs for the selected fixed-wing aircraft in our review. To identify the sustainment challenges and mitigation actions for the selected aircraft, we reviewed sustainment metrics data, performance briefings, and other relevant documentation to identify specific challenges for each of the 12 aircraft in our review. We also reviewed ongoing and planned actions to address those challenges. Additionally, we interviewed program officials, depot officials, field maintainers, and squadron personnel to obtain their views on the challenges they face in sustaining the aircraft and the actions they take to mitigate those challenges. In some instances, we visited depots and squadrons to observe aircraft undergoing maintenance, discuss the respective maintenance processes, and discuss challenges and mitigation actions with officials. We then grouped the identified challenges into categories and represented them in a table to demonstrate which aircraft are experiencing specific challenges. To assess the extent to which the Air Force and the Navy have sustainment strategies, regularly review sustainment metrics, and have plans to improve aircraft availability for the selected fixed-wing aircraft, we obtained and analyzed sustainment strategies, performance management frameworks (i.e., sustainment metrics collected and monitored as well as the levels of management review), and improvement plans for each of the selected 12 fixed-wing aircraft. We also identified and reviewed DOD, Air Force, and Navy guidance to analyze the departments\u2019 efforts in sustaining these aircraft and to determine whether these were consistent with federal standards for internal control that deal with management defining objectives in specific terms. Specifically, we reviewed DOD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, which provides management principles and mandatory policies for defense acquisition systems such as fixed- wing aircraft. These policies incorporate decision processes and assessing of readiness, which includes the creation of and requirements for a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan. We also reviewed Air Force Instruction 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, which implements various Air Force and DOD policy directives, including DOD Instruction 5000.02. It establishes the integrated life-cycle management guidelines and procedures for Air Force personnel who develop, review, approve, or manage the systems, subsystems, end-items, services, and activities procured by the Air Force. For the Navy, we reviewed Secretary of the Navy M-5000.2, Department of the Navy Acquisition and Capabilities Guidebook, which provides guidance for the operation of the defense acquisition system and the joint capabilities integration and development system. It also implements DOD Instruction 5000.02 for the Navy and Marine Corps, including guidance on the management and execution of a sustainment strategy. and service guidance. We also reviewed the Air Force\u2019s and the Navy\u2019s performance metric briefings and improvement plans to determine whether the departments regularly reviewed sustainment metrics and had plans aimed at improving aircraft availability. We interviewed DOD, Air Force, and Navy officials knowledgeable about sustainment of these selected fixed-wing aircraft to discuss DOD\u2019s and the departments\u2019 efforts in sustaining these aircraft, including historical information on each aircraft, applicability of policy and guidance for legacy aircraft, and overviews of performance management frameworks identified by the departments to monitor and improve aircraft availability. To develop the fixed-wing aircraft sustainment summary documents (i.e., \u201cSustainment Quick Looks\u201d) in appendixes II\u2013XIII we obtained historical and current information including background on aircraft capabilities, manufacturer, sustainment strategy, depot maintenance and squadron locations, and key dates in the life cycle of each aircraft (i.e., first manufactured, initial and full operational capability, last production, and planned sunset year). We collected and analyzed the following metrics: aircraft availability, not mission capable maintenance, not mission capable supply, and not mission capable aircraft from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017; the number of aircraft in depots for fiscal years 2011 through 2016; budgeted and executed flight hours from fiscal years 2011 through overall O&S and maintenance costs for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. We compared availability actuals to goals, aircraft in depots to availability trends, and budgeted and executed flight hours to availability trends. We analyzed O&S cost by reviewing its six elements and compared them to availability trends. We also analyzed the subcategories of the maintenance costs element. Through interviews with knowledgeable officials and reviewing documentation, we identified sustainment challenges (i.e., aging, maintenance and supply support) and mitigation actions to address these challenges for each selected fixed-wing aircraft. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable status, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours, to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only), which must be protected from public disclosure. This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Additionally, to support our work for each objective we conducted site visits and interviewed officials to discuss data trends and identify specific sustainment challenges such as aging, maintenance, and supply support, among other challenges affecting aircraft availability, and mitigation actions to address these challenges. For the Air Force, we met with the following entities: Headquarters\u2014Secretary of the Air Force, Logistics and Product Support and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cost and Economics, Air Force Cost Analysis Agency; Materiel Commands\u2014Air Force Materiel Command and Air Force Life Cycle Management Center; Program Offices\u2014B-52 Program Office, C-17 Program Office, E-8C Program Office, F-16 Program Office, and F-22 Program Office; Depots\u2014Tinker Air Force Base at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (B-52); Robins Air Force Base at Warner Robbins, Georgia (C-17); Northrop Grumman facility at Lake Charles, Louisiana (E-8C); Ogden Air Logistics Center / Hill Air Force Base at Ogden, Utah (F-16 and F-22); and Squadrons\u2014437th Maintenance Group, Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina (C-17); 461st Air Control Wing, Robins Air Force Base Georgia (E-8C); 20th Fighter Wing, Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina (F-16); and 325th Maintenance Group, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida (F-22). For the Navy, we met with the following entities: Headquarters\u2014Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy\u2014 Expeditionary Programs and Logistics Management, Marine Corps Aviation Plans and Policy Branch, and Air Warfare Division; Materiel Commands\u2014Commander, Fleet Readiness Center; Naval Air Systems Command; and Naval Supply Systems Command; Program Offices\u2014Program Manager\u2013Air (PMA)-231 (C-2A, E-2C, and E-2D); PMA- 257 (AV-8B); and PMA-265 (F/A-18A-F, and EA- 18G); Depots\u2014Fleet Readiness Center\u2013East at Cherry Point, North Carolina; Fleet Readiness Center\u2013Mid Atlantic at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia, and Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia; Squadrons\u2014Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina; Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California; Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia; and Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia; and Other\u2014Naval Center for Cost Analysis. The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted from September 2016 to April 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate, evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We subsequently worked with DOD from April 2018 to September 2018 to prepare this unclassified version of the original sensitive report for public release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with these standards. For fiscal year 2016, total operating and support (O&S) costs for the five Air Force fixed-wing aircraft selected in our review were about $12 billion, and the average O&S cost per aircraft across all five fleets was about $96 million, as shown in figure 32. Each of the C-17 and F-16 fleets accounted for about 33 percent of the total O&S cost, and the E-8C\u2019s average cost per aircraft accounted for about 48 percent of the total average cost per aircraft. For fiscal year 2016, total O&S costs for the seven Navy fixed-wing aircraft selected in our review were about $7.7 billion, and the average O&S cost per aircraft across all seven fleets was about $44 million, as shown in figure 33. The F/A-18E-F fleet accounted for about 40 percent of the total O&S cost, and the E-2C\u2019s average cost per aircraft accounted for about 19 percent of the total average cost per aircraft. In addition to the contact named above, John Bumgarner (Assistant Director), Clarine Allen, Ron Aribo, Vincent Buquicchio, Amie Lesser, Richard Powelson, Steven Putansu, Matt Spiers, and Natasha Wilder made key contributions to this report.

                "DOD spends billions of dollars annually to sustain its weapon systems to support current and future operations. The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a \u201cSustainment Quick Look.\u201d GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft\u20143 from each service\u2014between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs\u2014the largest share\u2014increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report. GAO is recommending that DOD and the Navy update or issue new policy and guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems. DOD concurred with the recommendations."

            "context": "Implementing Telework: The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (the Act) establishes telework implementation requirements for agencies, including, for example, that each agency designate a Telework Managing Officer and that each agency incorporate telework into its continuity of operations plans. The Act does not mention telework specifically in the context of space planning. The Act also requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to assess whether agencies have met agency- established telework outcome goals such as real estate savings. It also requires OPM to submit reports that include executive agencies\u2019 goals for increasing telework participation to the extent practicable, assist each agency with developing qualitative- and quantitative- teleworking measures and goals, and track telework eligibility and participation rates across the government. According to OPM telework information from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015, the percentage of federal workers eligible to telework remained stable at about 45 percent, on average. However, during the same period, the percentage of eligible employees who participated in telework increased from 29 percent to 46 percent. Figure 1 shows the frequency of telework across the federal government from fiscal years 2012 through 2015 by type of telework. Reducing Space: OMB issued the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and the Reduce the Footprint policy in 2015, which require all CFO Act agencies to improve the efficiency of real property use, control costs, and reduce holdings. These OMB initiatives also required agencies to develop Five-Year Real Property Efficiency Plans annually; develop office space standards that specify maximum square footage identify reduction targets for office space in square feet; and freeze the footprint (i.e., not increase square footage of office space). OMB\u2019s National Strategy noted that employee telework has changed the dynamic of the federal real property portfolio and resulted in a need for less space. OMB\u2019s Reduce the Footprint guidance memo states that agencies\u2019 5-year plans should include an explanation of actions the agency is taking to increase space efficiency, including cost-effective alternatives to acquisition of additional office space, such as consolidation, colocation, teleworking, and \u201choteling.\u201d Federal statute also requires that agencies consider whether space needs can be met using alternative workplace arrangements when deciding whether to acquire new space. GSA defines mobility as an overarching term describing the ability of employees, enabled by information technology (IT) and workplace policies to perform work both within and outside the agency worksite. Under this definition, mobility includes telework, desk-sharing, site work, and travel. Agencies can strategically use telework\u2014one form of mobility\u2014combined with desk-sharing and hoteling to reduce space needs and increase efficiency. This allows agencies to plan for fewer workstations than the number of employees. Other space efficiency strategies such as smaller workstations (e.g., reduced space standards), reconfigured office space (e.g., open-office plans instead of private offices), and mobile technology (e.g., laptops, Wi-Fi throughout the office, and smart phones) can be combined with telework and used as planning tools to reduce office space, use space more efficiently, and potentially cut costs. GSA, in a 2010 publication, described a continuum of three different scenarios for the ways agencies may use mobility, including telework. These scenarios range from limited mobility not leveraged for space planning to extensive mobility leveraged for space planning to reduce and use office space more efficiently: (1) No space changes: Some employees telework at least 2 scheduled days per week but retain assigned workstations with no changes to the existing space configuration. (2) No space reduction but different space allocation: Most employees telework at least 2 scheduled days per week and keep assigned workstations. Workstations are smaller and more densely organized; and space freed up by smaller workstations can be used for collaborative work spaces. (3) Space reduction and different space allocation: Nearly all employees telework at least 3 scheduled days per week and participate in hoteling (i.e., unassigned workstations), and workstations are also smaller and more densely organized. In this scenario, according to GSA, an agency can redesign its office and potentially reduce space by up to 30 percent. The key factors in distinguishing these scenarios illustrated in figure 2 below include the: level of employee participation in telework; changes to physical office spaces (e.g., smaller and more densely organized workstations and more emphasis on collaborative workspaces); and extent to which employees have assigned workstations or participate in desk-sharing. Under federal statute, GSA has a role in promulgating rules and developing guidance promoting the efficient use of real property. For example, the GSA Administrator may provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to client agencies regarding the establishment and operation of alternative workplace arrangements, which include leveraging telework to reduce space needs. GSA also directly assists client agencies with identifying and prioritizing opportunities to improve and implement real- property efficiency measures. In reviewing planning documents, policies, and survey data, we found that the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework to reduce or use space more efficiently. Specifically, our analysis of (1) agency-wide space-planning policies and procedures and (2) Real Property Efficiency Plans found that all of the agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies. Agencies also provided examples in survey responses of how they have used telework to increase operational effectiveness while optimizing their use of space. Fifteen agencies\u2019 space-planning policies and procedures included provisions for using telework and other mobility strategies, such as hoteling and desk-sharing, as a strategic space-planning tool. Three of the agencies mentioned these strategies only in the context of space planning, and five agencies did not mention them at all (see table 1). For the fifteen agencies with space planning policies that incorporated telework, the documents either expressly directed agency planners to include telework, hoteling, or desk-sharing in space planning; provided instructions and guidance for using these in space planning; or issued space allocation standards for their implementation. Several agency-wide space plans identify space reduction goals based on using telework strategically. For example, the Department of Transportation (DOT) documents identify a goal of at least a 10 percent workspace reduction in new acquisitions as a result of compressed work schedules and telework, and specifically state that employees who telework six or more days per pay period should not have a permanent workspace. Agency-wide space planning documents from three civilian CFO Act agencies mentioned telework, hoteling or desk-sharing as strategies in the context of space planning. For example, DOJ\u2019s agency-wide policy notes that telework and hoteling could increase the efficient use of space and directs each sub-agency to maintain its own space design guidelines within agency-wide policy office space standards. The other two agencies, the Department of State and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, either had a short provisional agency-wide space planning document that laid out space standards or mentioned telework, hoteling and desk-sharing as a tool for creating sustainable space. Five agencies\u2019 space planning documents made no reference to telework; however, one agency, OPM, developed a maximum office space utilization rate and criteria for determining which positions require a private office. As noted above, OMB\u2019s Reduce the Footprint policy (2015) requires agencies to establish Real Property Efficiency Plans. In our analysis of the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2016 or 2017 plans, we found that 19 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning. A few agencies\u2019 Real Property Efficiency Plans explicitly stated that the agency reduced space as a result of telework. For example, GSA used telework to reduce space in its Heartland, Rocky Mountain, and National Capital Region offices. Some (5 of 23) Real Property Efficiency Plans discussed the telework pilot programs agencies have initiated. For example, the Department of Education\u2019s plans reported using a pilot program to acclimate employees to teleworking and desk-sharing; as a result, the agency intends to incorporate hoteling or space-sharing opportunities into proposed space designs in future projects. The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans also reported initiating a pilot program to experiment with smaller \u201choteling\u201d workspaces. Similarly, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s plan reported conducting a pilot program at its headquarters offices to identify challenges, better understand telework, and evaluate the potential of shared workspaces. In response to our survey, about three-quarters of agencies reported space-planning policies that use telework to reduce office space, lower real estate costs, or reduce the size of individual workstations. Agencies reported accomplishing this by using desk-sharing and hoteling for employees who have relinquished permanent workspaces. For example, several agencies discussed strategies to reduce space in their responses to our survey. The Department of Labor reported using telework to close some small offices resulting in overall space reductions of about 16,000 square feet. OPM reported that it both reduced space and created space efficiencies by transitioning staff in its Eastern Management Development Center to full-time telework and terminating the lease, resulting in a space reduction of about 32,000 square feet. OPM\u2019s Human Resource Solutions Program also achieved a 47 percent space reduction when it instituted desk-sharing and freed the vacated space for use by another program office. The Department of the Treasury reported that its sub-agency, the Internal Revenue Service, has aggressively used telework to help reduce its real property portfolio, while other Treasury units have leveraged telework to achieve significant space reductions. At the end of fiscal year 2016, Treasury reported agency-wide reductions of about 484,000 square feet at a cost savings of about $10 million. Two agencies\u2013\u2013Department of Homeland Security, and the National Science Foundation\u2013\u2013reported using telework to increase the efficiency of existing office space in sub-agencies by increasing staff without increasing the size of offices, for example: The Department of Homeland Security reported that one of its sub- agencies used telework in the planning and design of a new office, resulting in both a space reduction and more efficient use of the space. The new office is 57,573 square feet smaller than the prior office while personnel assigned to the office increased from 315 to 394. The National Science Foundation reported that it used teleworking, among other workspace strategies such as new space standards and virtual technologies, to increase staff numbers without increasing its real estate footprint. Among the agencies we reviewed in detail\u2014GSA, OJP, CDC, and the Fiscal Service\u2014the use of telework in office space planning varied from emerging consideration to extensive implementation. GSA and OJP have used telework extensively to both reduce space and increase space efficiency in their office spaces. CDC has leveraged telework to reduce space or use space more efficiently in more limited cases while the Fiscal Service has begun to consider telework in future space planning. Appendix II provides additional details on office spaces where these agencies reduced space or used space more efficiently, including the role of telework, if any. GSA has leveraged telework to reduce space by implementing unassigned workstations in nearly all of its regional and headquarters offices, along with other forms of \u201cemployee mobility,\u201d complementary IT, and smaller space standards. GSA adopted telework as early as 1999 and by fiscal year 2015, more than 90 percent of all eligible GSA employees teleworked, and nearly half of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. GSA\u2019s space policy cites desk-sharing (e.g., hoteling, \u201chot-desking,\u201d or other arrangements) as one strategy to help meet its space standard of 136 useable square feet (USF) per person. GSA employees may telework full-time, but may be required to give up dedicated workstations if they are on site 2 or fewer days per week. GSA has gradually transitioned to unassigned workstations at headquarters and in its regional offices, allowing the agency to implement desk-sharing and calculate space needs at less than one desk per employee. The agency also assigned laptops and mobile or soft phones to employees to further maximize mobility. The three GSA sites we visited used space-planning strategies to achieve, or nearly achieve, GSA\u2019s space standard of 136 USF per person. For example, at its Philadelphia Regional Office, GSA leveraged existing telework levels to meet reduced space standards and move to a smaller leased space by accommodating about 600 employees in fewer than 500 workstations. According to GSA, this allowed the office to achieve a utilization rate of 139 USF per person and realize a reported annual rent cost savings of about $2 million. Similarly, at its New York Regional Office, GSA also leveraged existing telework levels to meet reduced space standards and move to a smaller leased space. This step allowed the office to achieve a utilization rate of 119 USF per person and realize a reported total rent cost savings of nearly $11 million. GSA also leveraged telework as part of its headquarters consolidation. GSA reports that it was able to move approximately 1,000 additional employees to the headquarters building by implementing a hoteling system and planning for less than one workstation per employee. This allowed GSA to achieve a utilization rate of 138 USF per person at its headquarters and realize a reported annual rent-cost savings of approximately $24 million. Similar to GSA, OJP used telework, along with complementary tools, to reduce space and use space more efficiently at its consolidated office. More than 90 percent of eligible employees teleworked in fiscal year 2015, and nearly half of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. More recently, OJP reported that around 70 percent of its employees teleworked in August 2017, with just less than 40 percent doing so three or more days per pay period. At the departmental level, DOJ\u2019s plans to improve space utilization include reduced space requirements, and, in some cases, alternative workplace strategies. DOJ\u2019s space utilization policy mentions telework with hoteling as one way to increase efficient use of space, and DOJ\u2019s telework policy mentions the potential of telework to create cost savings by decreasing space needs. While most OJP employees are eligible to telework, a few federal staff occupying administrative positions are not eligible. OJP took the opportunity to examine and improve its space use as three of its leases approached expiration in 2013. It leased space in two adjacent buildings under three separate leases. OJP worked with GSA to analyze space-planning options, contracting a study of the office that recommended ways to improve space utilization. This study included a survey of all employees, a complete physical space survey, and interviews with leadership. The results of this study not only indicated OJP employees\u2019 openness to more mobility but also that they had concerns such as loss of privacy and social connectedness. For example, more than 80 percent of survey respondents said they could work off-site more often with proper tools and support, and almost half said they would give up dedicated space to work remotely more often. Furthermore, interviews with the leadership of several OJP units indicated a willingness to support increased mobility but also a need to maintain privacy and improve mobile IT. According to OJP, it alleviated these concerns by encouraging participation in the planning process, highlighting opportunities for positive changes, and maintaining open communication (e.g., communicating changes and expected benefits). Based on the analysis of space-planning options, OJP retained one of the three previous leases and leveraged telework to accommodate all employees into less space overall in one building. OJP achieved this objective by targeting 25 percent employee mobility and implementing hoteling. Concurrently, OJP officials explained that they introduced smaller workstations and used tenant-improvement allowance funds to reconfigure space for more flexible use. Physical reconfigurations included changing hard-walled office spaces with dedicated workstations to a primarily open office with few walls or dedicated workstations. According to OJP, it complemented these changes with investments in mobile IT for individual employees, improved IT capabilities in conference rooms and other collaborative spaces, and an emphasis on training employees to work well in a mobile office environment. For example, OJP officials said they installed Wi-Fi throughout the space, issued laptops and smart phones to employees, upgraded video-conferencing capabilities in conference rooms and collaborative spaces, and expanded tools for informal employee communication. According to OJP officials, through the consolidation, they said they achieved a utilization rate of 190 USF per person\u2014a decrease of 30 USF per person from the prior 220 utilization rate. This rate remained higher than DOJ\u2019s overall target and housed the same total number of employees\u2014about 1,000\u2014in about 50,000 fewer USF. OJP reports that the consolidation resulted in an estimated $3 million annual lease- cost savings. OJP also estimates additional savings from reduced transit subsidies, carbon emissions, and continuity of operations. Relative to GSA and OJP, CDC has made more limited use of telework in office space-planning. CDC officials told us that they have leveraged telework as a space-planning tool in many locations, but they have only documented doing so in one case. HHS expects each sub-agency to comply with its 170 USF per-person utilization-rate policy, and this policy suggests that planned space reductions should take telework into account. As a component of HHS, CDC has its own space policy, which states that telework, desk-sharing, and hoteling can help CDC\u2019s units meet HHS\u2019s utilization rate policy of 170 USF per person. CDC\u2019s telework policy requires employees who telework frequently to agree to participate in desk-sharing, but according to CDC officials, how and to what extent this portion of the broader policy is implemented is up to the discretion of management. CDC officials cited two limitations to further implementing space sharing techniques: (1) the large number of employees\u2019 who may be unable to telework on certain days based upon their job responsibilities and (2) the voluntary nature of telework. Some CDC employees cannot work off-site at least some of the time due to confidential data or lab-based work. Approximately 60 percent of eligible CDC employees teleworked in fiscal year 2015 and about one-quarter of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. CDC officials told us that telework participation ranges from 49 to 86 percent across CDC units. CDC\u2019s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion\u2019s office in Chamblee, GA, provides the most clearly documented case of CDC\u2019s leveraging telework for space efficiency. According to CDC officials, this unit accommodated more than 300 additional employees within its existing space by implementing hoteling for employees who telework 4 or more days per pay period, and it continues to use hoteling as part of its space management strategy. In contrast, CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) office in Hyattsville, MD, reduced space without leveraging telework by reconfiguring the space with smaller, soft-walled workstations. CDC officials told us that NCHS reduced its office space from seven floors to three and three-quarters floors, resulting in a reported space reduction of more than 40 percent and allowing it to achieve a 170 USF per person utilization rate. CDC officials reported that this space reduction resulted in annual rent cost savings of approximately $1 million. Hoteling was not feasible at this location because work on confidential data limits the ability of employees to work off-site, and NCHS employees also prefer dedicated workstations. CDC officials said that there is limited documentation of any additional cases of CDC\u2019s leveraging telework as a space- planning tool because, prior to our review, there had been no formal request to connect telework and space utilization data. In contrast to GSA, OJP, and CDC, telework as a space-planning tool is an emerging consideration at the Fiscal Service. At the departmental level, Treasury has space standards that aim for efficient and effective offices that use increased telework and shared workstations to minimize the number of dedicated workstations. Similarly, objectives of the Fiscal Service telework policy include cost savings from reduced office space needs. Treasury\u2019s space standards specify a planned maximum utilization rate of 200 USF per person for facilities with general office space, and the Fiscal Service reported that its average office space-utilization rate was 183 USF per person at the time of our review. Treasury policy also recommends hoteling for employees who are out of the office 80 or more hours per month, but the Fiscal Service told us that it would like to conduct additional desk-sharing pilots to assess their impact before negotiating broader desk-sharing with the union. At the Fiscal Service, approximately 80 percent of eligible employees teleworked in fiscal year 2015, and about one-quarter of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. The Fiscal Service reported that approximately 80 percent of Fiscal Service employees telework at its Washington, D.C., Maryland, and West Virginia locations. At the time of our review, the Fiscal Service officials said the agency had reduced space without leveraging telework or implementing hoteling, instead relying on smaller space standards (i.e., fewer square feet per workstation) to lease smaller offices. For example, the Fiscal Service reduced space by giving up several floors at its Hyattsville, MD, office starting in 2012. According to Fiscal Service officials, they accomplished these reductions by consolidating data centers to other locations, conducting targeted buyouts of employees, and, most recently, by implementing a new space standard of 183 USF per person through smaller workstations. The officials said that the most recent space reduction at this location resulted in savings in annual rent costs not attributable to telework. Looking forward, the Fiscal Service reported that it has started taking preliminary steps to promote efficient space utilization through telework. These steps have included: creating an Executive Space Management Council that discussed incorporating telework and desk-sharing into space management guidelines; implementing a voluntary, informal desk-sharing pilot in one program area for employees who already telework 50 percent or more of the time; and seeking information from GSA, including discussing and visiting GSA offices that have implemented hoteling as part of their space planning model. In addition, the Fiscal Service officials told us that the agency plans to negotiate the impact and implementation of desk-sharing and hoteling for telework employees with its union, but the Fiscal Service has not yet begun this effort. Our analysis of the survey responses from the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies identified three major planning challenges agencies face with using telework to reduce space: human capital issues such as negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change; the suitability of telework to mission work requirements; and difficulty measuring cost savings that might result from space reductions attributable to telework. This measuring difficulty may include both gross savings as well as savings net of costs, such as for renovations or IT investments. See table 3 for examples of space-planning challenges related to telework reported by the 23 agencies. To address these challenges, nearly two thirds of the agencies we surveyed reported they would like guidance on using telework programs or other alternatives to meet the federal goals of reducing space or using space more efficiently. Our review of agency survey responses, Real Property Efficiency Plans, and other agency space-planning documents, found that human capital challenges to using telework in space planning generally fell into two categories: (1) requirements to negotiate space allocation changes with collective-bargaining units; and (2) managing department workforces in adapting to new workspace designs and altered workspace allocations. Collective-bargaining challenges: Of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, 7 of 23 noted that changes to telework policy or workspace arrangements required negotiation with collective bargaining units, for example, The Small Business Administration (SBA) reported its greatest challenge to incorporating telework in office space planning has been with negotiating and securing agreement from all parties, including management and its union, on establishing space standards. HUD reported that it could not implement hoteling or desk-sharing as its collective-bargaining agreements require that each employee retain an assigned workstation regardless of an employee\u2019s type of telework agreement. SSA reported that changing floor plans required negotiation with its three collective-bargaining units, which could extend the time needed for construction and relocation. DOT reported that collective-bargaining agreements posed a challenge to incorporating workforce mobility options, including telework. In addition, the collective-bargaining agreements we reviewed from the four agencies we reviewed in detail\u2013\u2013GSA, OJP, CDC and Fiscal Service\u2013\u2013required negotiations or the opportunity to negotiate changes to matters relating to workspace arrangements and in some cases, to telework policy. Managing change: Using telework as a strategic space-planning tool, particularly in conjunction with complementary space-saving efforts such as desk-sharing, hoteling, or open-space designs, generally involves a cultural change. Nine of the 23 agencies we surveyed reported challenges associated with managing change. For example, three agencies reported employees\u2019 discomfort or apprehension about desk-sharing and hoteling. In 2013, we reported that organizations may also encounter concerns from agency leaders, managers, employees, or employee organizations when introducing physical space changes associated with increased workforce mobility (telework). More recently, we reported that management concerns remain the most frequently reported barrier to expanding telework. Two private sector experts we met with underscored the importance of management \u201cbuy-in\u201d saying it was imperative that senior executives fully support the initiative to facilitate the necessary cultural change for agencies to use telework in space planning. One noted that management needed to make the business case to employees so that each layer of the organization could understand the importance of the initiative and its potential benefits. Another suggested a change management plan tailored to the work performed within a unit. This individual said that key components of such a plan might include studying existing work practices and program requirements, surveying employee preferences, and including employees in the planning process. Further, a GSA document circulated in response to the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 mentions obtaining supervisory \u201cbuy-in\u201d or support as key to facilitating change. According to survey responses, within agencies there are sub-agencies that have individual mission requirements that may or may not be suitable for telework. This makes it difficult for agencies to implement overarching telework and space planning policies that apply department-wide. Sub- agencies and units within sub-agencies must individually determine if telework is appropriate given their particular mission requirements. For example, the Veterans Administration reported that although it developed an agency-wide telework policy, each sub-agency and supervisor has the flexibility to implement telework based on operational needs. Moreover, because the agency\u2019s core mission involves direct services to veterans, about 83 percent of agency staff positions are not suitable for telework. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 outlines two broad exceptions to telework participation for employees: (1) directly handling secure materials determined to be inappropriate for telework by the agency head and (2) on-site activity that cannot be handled remotely or at an alternative worksite. In cases where telework does not support an agency\u2019s mission or where a particular mission may require increases or decreases in personnel, telework as a strategic space-planning tool may not work. About half (12 of 23) of the agencies we surveyed reported that office space reductions resulting from using telework in space planning led to real estate cost savings while the other half reported either that cost savings did not result or they did not know. GSA officials told us that calculating cost savings attributable to a particular aspect of space planning is complicated as several factors contribute to savings. In particular, in survey responses, the Departments of Education, Energy, and Agriculture reiterated this point. OMB\u2019s National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and its Reduce the Footprint policy encourage agencies to increase and maximize efficiencies in office space by implementing cost-effective strategies such as telework. For example, the National Strategy outlines a framework that aims to measure real property costs and utilization to improve the efficient use of federal real property. The Reduce the Footprint policy requires agencies to measure cost savings that result from reducing space through disposals. However, neither document offers guidance or methodologies on how to measure the costs or savings that may result from using telework. We previously reported that GSA works with client agencies to develop tools to measure office space utilization and, in 2013, was developing an Excel-based tool to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of using telework to achieve greater office space efficiencies. This tool\u2014the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool\u2014is aimed at helping agencies quantify the benefits and costs of increased telework participation and implementing other alternative-work arrangements. When completed, the tool will enable users to quickly develop rough estimates of cost and space impacts resulting from workplace changes, particularly relating to desk-sharing, workspace reconfiguration, and consolidation. Key features include the ability to compare up to three scenarios, which in turn may be used to inform a more detailed design program. As of January 2018, GSA had not yet completed the tool. GSA officials said mission needs, resource constraints, and developmental adjustments have contributed to delays in the time frame for completing the tool. They added that during this time, GSA has diverted resources to space calculation tools for individual agencies. For example, GSA worked with DHS on its Space Calculation Tool as a way to help determine workplace space requirements in a manner consistent with DHS space policies. In January 2018, GSA officials told us that they plan to make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to GSA staff in March 2018 along with training on how to use it. However, GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies to use as a space-planning tool. Instead, the officials plan to assess GSA\u2019s use of the tool and then determine in late 2018 if and how it should be released to other agencies for independent use. Given the absence of a government-wide tool, in our review, we found that some agencies had used their own resources to purchase similar tools for their space-planning needs from the private sector. Without such a government-wide resource, agencies may not be able to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently. In responses to our survey, nearly two-thirds of agencies reported that they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources to assist them in using telework as a space-planning tool. As noted above, a key element of GSA\u2019s mission is to provide guidance and services that enable agencies to improve space utilization, reduce costs, and better achieve their missions. Moreover, under federal statute, GSA may provide guidance to executive agencies on the implementation of alternative workplace arrangements, which includes telework. Federal standards for internal control also call for agencies to communicate necessary quality information such as guidance with external parties. In reviewing GSA\u2019s websites, we found that GSA last developed formal guidance on alternative workplace arrangements in 2006 and maintains several separate informational websites on implementing telework and optimizing space utilization. Our review of this guidance and these websites found that they do not provide specific guidance for using telework as a strategic space-planning tool. For example, the 2006 guidance is generally limited to defining the factors agency heads must contemplate when considering alternative workplace arrangements along with the equipment and technical services agencies may provide for alternative worksites. However, this guidance does not address in detail the impact of such arrangements on agency office space and resulting planning issues. Similarly, our review of GSA\u2019s teleworking and space- planning websites found that although they separately offered documented case studies along with information such as tips for implementing telework and managing a mobile workforce, GSA did not provide documents consolidating the concept of using telework as a strategic space-planning tool. For example, information on GSA\u2019s Total Workplace Program website\u2013\u2013intended to assist agencies in using workforce mobility (including telework) to increase space efficiencies\u2013\u2013is generally limited. Although this website includes high-level information that describes the potential benefits of using telework with office space planning and design, it lacks a practical outline of the process agencies might use to achieve them. Because the information in the 2006 guidance and the telework and space-planning websites is neither specific nor detailed, it is of limited assistance for agencies that would like to use telework as a strategic space-planning tool to meet the goals of a more efficient use of space. While using telework to reduce space is not a new challenge, it has become more pressing with OMB\u2019s requirement for federal agencies to explore alternatives to acquiring more office space. Most civilian CFO Act agencies reported having a telework program in place and some reported success with using it in space planning to reduce space or accommodate more employees without increasing space. However, many of the agencies continue to face challenges and do not believe that they have adequate information, assistance, or resources to assist them in using telework as a space-planning tool or assess its costs and benefits. Until agencies have access to detailed guidance and tools to help utilize various space-planning options, they may not be able to effectively identify opportunities to use telework toward the goal of reducing their real property footprint. We are making the following two recommendations to GSA: The Administrator of General Services should ensure that the appropriate GSA offices develop guidance including, but not limited to, how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool for reducing and optimizing office space efficiency and that the offices make the guidance readily available. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of General Services should ensure the appropriate GSA offices complete the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool and make it available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework to achieve office space efficiencies. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to GSA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of the Treasury. In its written comments, reproduced in Appendix III, GSA concurred with our recommendations and stated that it is developing a plan to address them. We received technical comments from the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, which we incorporated where appropriate. The Department of the Treasury did not have comments on our draft report. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Administrator of GSA; and the Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of the Treasury, and the Attorney General of the Department of Justice. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff has any questions concerning this report, please contact me at (202) 512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff that made key contributions to this report is listed in appendix III. This report addresses: (1) how the 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. To determine how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning, we surveyed the agencies. The survey asked questions about agency-wide efforts to use telework in the human- capital and space-planning areas; whether agencies had achieved any cost savings as a result; the challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning; and asked agencies to identify additional information, resources, or guidance that might be helpful. In addition to the survey questions, we asked each agency real property officer to provide copies of agency-wide space-planning documents and the Real Property Efficiency Plans agencies prepared for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 pursuant to the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Reduce the Footprint policy. We developed survey questions based on our review of the relevant literature, white papers from federal agencies and private sector entities, and past GAO reports. We pre- tested the survey instrument with three federal agencies to ascertain: (1) the clarity of survey questions; (2) the precision of language; and 3) the availability of information queried. As a result of the pre-tests we made changes to the content and format of the survey where appropriate. We received survey responses from each of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies in addition to requested space-planning documents and Real Property Efficiency Plans, and thus achieved a 100 percent response rate. We analyzed survey results by calculating the frequency of responses to dichotomous questions (i.e., questions requiring a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer). We also conducted a content analysis on the open-ended, narrative-based questions by identifying common themes and tabulating results. We also conducted a content analysis to determine the extent to which agencies referenced telework in their agency-wide space-planning documents and in their Real Property Efficiency Plans. To accomplish these analyses, we developed separate coding schemes for each of the two types of documents. These were based on information obtained in our literature review, interviews with subject matter experts, and our professional judgment. We then identified relevant sections and common themes, and coded and tabulated the results. To validate the coding results, we used a second, independent coder. To determine the specific ways agencies include telework in their office space planning, we selected a non-generalizable sample of three CFO Act agency sub-agencies as illustrative case studies. To select sub- agencies, we analyzed data from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Public Use 2014-2015 Telework Data call. First, we applied two selection criteria: (1) agency-wide progress toward a stated goal of using telework to reduce real estate costs, and (2) agency-reported data indicating that more than 25 percent of sub-agency employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period. Next, we considered variations in sub-agency size and percentage of employees eligible to telework. Finally, we excluded candidates that had recently been selected for related GAO work and we excluded sub-agencies related to agency administration such as Offices of Inspector General or Secretary-level offices. We assessed the reliability of the OPM\u2019s data by interviews with knowledgeable officials and by reviewing prior assessments of the same data, and we found the data reliable for our purposes. As a result of this process, we selected (1) the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service); (2) the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and (3) the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP). For each of the selected agencies, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed their telework and space- planning documents. We also visited four sub-agency office locations to determine if and how telework played a role in any space reductions or efficiencies along with any associated cost savings. In addition to these three sub-agencies, we used the General Services Administration (GSA) as a comparative example since it is responsible for providing space- planning guidance to client agencies and has experience using telework in space planning. We interviewed GSA officials, reviewed relevant documents, and visited three GSA office locations with recent space reductions or efficiencies. In total, we conducted seven site visits including two Fiscal Service locations, one location each for CDC and OJP, and three GSA locations (National Headquarters, Region 2 Office, and Region 3 Office) in Washington, D.C.; New York City; and Philadelphia, respectively. To identify any challenges the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning, we analyzed results from survey questions addressed to challenges, interviewed sub-agency and GSA officials as detailed above, interviewed two private sector subject matter experts, and representatives from four private-sector entities that had reported using telework to reduce and use office space more efficiently. Statements made by knowledgeable federal officials, outside experts and private sector entities are not generalizable to the universe of civilian CFO Act agencies. We also analyzed the section of each of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies\u2019 Real Property Efficiency Plans devoted to challenges agency face in reducing space. We selected the two subject matter experts\u2013\u2013representatives from Global Workplace Analytics and Fentress Facility Planning and Analytics\u2013\u2013based on: (1) their experience working with federal agencies to incorporate telework programs into the space planning process; (2) information compiled in our literature review; (3) prior GAO reports; (4) internal GAO recommendations; and (5) industry recommendations. We selected the four private sector entities (AT&T, Deloitte, Adobe, and CapitalOne) based on our literature review, recommendations from industry experts, and reports of having achieved space efficiencies including space reduction, cost savings, or cost avoidance(s). To identify what guidance or information on using telework as a space- planning tool GSA makes available through its website, we reviewed the contents of multiple GSA websites including Telework, Total Workplace, Alternative Work, and GSA Telework Resources. We followed links and reviewed webpage contents for information on how agencies might use telework as a strategic tool to reduce space or use space more efficiently. We compared GSA\u2019s guidance and website information to relevant statutory requirements and federal internal controls standards related to external communication. We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In addition to the contact named above, David J. Wise (Director); Amelia Bates Shachoy (Assistant Director); Lindsay Bach (Analyst-in-Charge); Geoff Hamilton; Malika Rice; Kelly Rubin; Shelia Thorpe; Elise Vaughan Winfrey; and Amelia Michelle Weathers made key contributions to this report.",

                "Federal agencies are exploring ways to use telework as a tool to reduce the federal footprint and use space more efficiently. GAO was asked to examine the effects of telework on agencies' space-planning efforts. In this report, GAO reviewed: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO surveyed all 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, analyzed each agency's space-planning documents, and Real Property Efficiency Plans . GAO reviewed four agencies in greater detail based on analysis of telework data and other factors. For those four agencies GAO conducted site visits, interviewed officials, and analyzed agency documents. GAO also identified challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning, based on survey results, agency documents, and interviews. The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported various ways of considering and using telework as a space-planning tool, by, for example, implementing desk-sharing for employees who telework in order to relinquish leased space, or increasing the number of staff working in an existing space without increasing its size. All of the 23 agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies in either their space-planning documents or Real Property Efficiency Plans . The agencies that used telework as a space-planning tool generally reported implementing smaller or unassigned workstations. Three of the four agencies GAO reviewed in greater detail\u2013\u2013the General Services Administration (GSA); the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice; the Centers for Disease Control at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Department of the Treasury\u2013\u2013leveraged telework to reduce or use office space more efficiently. For example, GSA and the Office of Justice Programs used telework to accommodate more employees in a smaller office space as illustrated in figure 1 below. The Centers for Disease Control used telework to accommodate more employees in the same amount of space. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service reduced space without telework by reducing the size of individual workstations. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported several challenges in using telework to reduce space including human capital issues, mission suitability, and measuring cost savings attributable to telework. About two-thirds of the agencies said they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources in using telework as a space-planning tool. GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool\u2014the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework\u2013\u2013remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies. As such, agencies reported that they lack adequate guidance to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently, and how to assess the benefits and costs of using telework in space planning. GSA concurred with recommendations that GSA should: (1) develop guidance on how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make this guidance readily available and (2) complete and make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework."

            "context": "IT systems supporting federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are inherently at risk. These systems are highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. This complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices comprising the systems and networks. Compounding the risk, federal systems and networks are also often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the Internet. This increases the number of avenues of attack and expands their attack surface. As systems become more integrated, cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to national security, economic well-being, and public health and safety. Advancements in technology, such as data analytics software for searching and collecting information, have also made it easier for individuals and organizations to correlate data (including PII) and track it across large and numerous databases. For example, social media has been used as a mass communication tool where PII can be gathered in vast amounts. In addition, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity makes it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information pinpointing their locations. These advances\u2014combined with the increasing sophistication of hackers and others with malicious intent, and the extent to which both federal agencies and private companies collect sensitive information about individuals\u2014have increased the risk of PII being exposed and compromised. Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact entities across various critical infrastructure sectors. For example, in its 2018 annual data breach investigations report, Verizon reported that 53,308 security incidents and 2,216 data breaches were identified across 65 countries in the 12 months since its prior report. Further, the report noted that cybercriminals can often compromise a system in just a matter of minutes\u2014or even seconds, but that it can take an organization significantly longer to discover the breach. Specifically, the report stated nearly 90 percent of the reported breaches occurred within minutes, while nearly 70 percent went undiscovered for months. These concerns are further highlighted by the number of information security incidents reported by federal executive branch civilian agencies to DHS\u2019s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). For fiscal year 2017, 35,277 such incidents were reported by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its 2018 annual report to Congress, as mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). These incidents include, for example, web-based attacks, phishing, and the loss or theft of computing equipment. Different types of incidents merit different response strategies. However, if an agency cannot identify the threat vector (or avenue of attack), it could be difficult for that agency to define more specific handling procedures to respond to the incident and take actions to minimize similar future attacks. In this regard, incidents with a threat vector categorized as \u201cother\u201d (which includes avenues of attacks that are unidentified) made up 31 percent of the various incidents reported to US-CERT. Figure 1 shows the percentage of the different types of incidents reported across each of the nine threat vector categories for fiscal year 2017, as reported by OMB. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following examples highlight the impact of such incidents: In March 2018, the Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, reported that the city was victimized by a ransomware cyberattack. As a result, city government officials stated that customers were not able to access multiple applications that are used to pay bills or access court related information. In response to the attack, the officials noted that they were working with numerous private and governmental partners, including DHS, to assess what occurred and determine how best to protect the city from future attacks. In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the department, the nine Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and five federal government agencies, among other entities. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted the systems of multiple U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors. Specifically, the alert stated that Russian government actors had affected multiple organizations in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, construction, and critical manufacturing sectors. In July 2017, a breach at Equifax resulted in the loss of PII for an estimated 148 million U.S. consumers. According to Equifax, the hackers accessed people\u2019s names, Social Security numbers (SSN), birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver\u2019s license numbers. In April 2017, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) testified that the IRS had disabled its data retrieval tool in early March 2017 after becoming concerned about the misuse of taxpayer data. Specifically, the agency suspected that PII obtained outside the agency\u2019s tax system was used to access the agency\u2019s online federal student aid application in an attempt to secure tax information through the data retrieval tool. In April 2017, the agency began notifying taxpayers who could have been affected by the breach. In June 2015, OPM reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate, but related, incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for 21.5 million individuals. In total, OPM estimated 22.1 million individuals had some form of PII stolen, with 3.6 million being a victim of both breaches. Safeguarding federal IT systems and the systems that support critical infrastructures has been a long-standing concern of GAO. Due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of information security vulnerabilities, we have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In 2003, we expanded the information security high-risk area to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure. At that time, we highlighted the need to manage critical infrastructure protection activities that enhance the security of the cyber and physical public and private infrastructures that are essential to national security, national economic security, and/or national public health and safety. We further expanded the information security high-risk area in 2015 to include protecting the privacy of PII. Since then, advances in technology have enhanced the ability of government and private sector entities to collect and process extensive amounts of PII, which has posed challenges to ensuring the privacy of such information. In addition, high- profile PII breaches at commercial entities, such as Equifax, heightened concerns that personal privacy is not being adequately protected. Our experience has shown that the key elements needed to make progress toward being removed from the High-Risk List are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five criteria for removal, as well as any needed congressional action. The five criteria for removal that we identified in November 2000 are as follows: Leadership Commitment. Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support. Capacity. The agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve the risk(s). Action Plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root cause, solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions we recommended. Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures. Demonstrated Progress. Ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area. These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately address high-risk issues. Addressing some of the criteria leads to progress, while satisfying all of the criteria is central to removal from the list. Figure 2 shows the five criteria and illustrative actions taken by agencies to address the criteria. Importantly, the actions listed are not \u201cstand alone\u201d efforts taken in isolation from other actions to address high- risk issues. That is, actions taken under one criterion may be important to meeting other criteria as well. For example, top leadership can demonstrate its commitment by establishing a corrective action plan including long-term priorities and goals to address the high-risk issue and using data to gauge progress\u2014actions which are also vital to monitoring criteria. As we reported in the February 2017 high-risk report, the federal government\u2019s efforts to address information security deficiencies had fully met one of the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List\u2014 leadership commitment\u2014and partially met the other four, as shown in figure 3. We plan to update our assessment of this high-risk area against the five criteria in February 2019. Based on our prior work, we have identified four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, we have identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take (see figure 4). The four challenges and the 10 actions needed to address them are summarized following the table. In addition, we also discuss in more detail each of the 10 actions in appendices II through XI. The federal government has been challenged in establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and in performing effective oversight as called for by federal law and policy. Specifically, we have previously reported that the federal government has faced challenges in establishing a comprehensive strategy to provide a framework for how the United States will engage both domestically and internationally on cybersecurity related matters. We have also reported on challenges in performing oversight, including monitoring the global supply chain, ensuring a highly skilled cyber workforce, and addressing risks associated with emerging technologies. The federal government can take four key actions to improve the nation\u2019s strategic approach to, and oversight of, cybersecurity. Develop and execute a more comprehensive federal strategy for national cybersecurity and global cyberspace. In February 2013 we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy- related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the private sector; however, no overarching cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set time frames for their completion. In October 2015, in response to our recommendation to develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that included all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy, the Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer issued a Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The plan also identified key milestones for major activities, resources needed to accomplish milestones, and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy\u2019s milestones. Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. For example, a May 2017 presidential executive order required federal agencies to take a variety of actions, including better manage their cybersecurity risks and coordinate to meet reporting requirements related to cybersecurity of federal networks, critical infrastructure, and the nation. Additionally, the December 2017 National Security Strategy cites cybersecurity as a national priority and identifies related needed actions, such as including identifying and prioritizing risk, and building defensible government networks. Further, DHS issued a cybersecurity strategy in May 2018, which articulated seven goals the department plans to accomplish in support of its mission related to managing national cybersecurity risks. The strategy is intended to provide DHS with a framework to execute its cybersecurity responsibilities during the next 5 years to keep pace with the evolving cyber risk landscape by reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience; countering malicious actors in cyberspace; responding to incidents; and making the cyber ecosystem more secure and resilient. These efforts provide a good foundation toward establishing a more comprehensive strategy, but more effort is needed to address all of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we have previously recommended. The recently issued executive branch strategy documents did not include key elements of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy as guidance for decision makers in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. Specifically, the documents generally did not include milestones and performance measures to gauge results, nor did they describe the resources needed to carry out the goals and objective. Further, most of the strategy documents lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities for key agencies, such as DHS, the Department of Defense (DOD), and OMB, who contribute substantially to the nation\u2019s cybersecurity programs. Ultimately, a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening persistent weaknesses. For more information on this action area, see appendix II. Mitigate global supply chain risks. The global, geographically disperse nature of the producers and suppliers of IT products is a growing concern. We have previously reported on potential issues associated with IT supply chain and risks originating from foreign- manufactured equipment. For example, in July 2017, we reported that the Department of State had relied on certain device manufacturers, software developers, and contractor support which had suppliers that were reported to be headquartered in a cyber-threat nation (e.g., China and Russia). We further pointed out that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal agencies, including insertion of counterfeits, tampering, or installation of malicious software or hardware. In July 2018, we testified that if such global IT supply chain risks are realized, they could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists for serious adverse impact on an agency\u2019s operations, assets, and employees. These factors highlight the importance and urgency of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risk as part of their agency-wide information security programs. For more information on this action area, see appendix III. Address cybersecurity workforce management challenges. The federal government faces challenges in ensuring that the nation\u2019s cybersecurity workforce has the appropriate skills. For example, in June 2018, we reported on federal efforts to implement the requirements of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015. We determined that most of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies had not fully implemented all statutory requirements, such as developing procedures for assigning codes to cybersecurity positions. Further, we have previously reported that DHS and DOD had not addressed cybersecurity workforce management requirements set forth in federal laws. In addition, we have reported in the last 2 years that federal agencies (1) had not identified and closed cybersecurity skills gaps, (2) had been challenged with recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and (3) had difficulty navigating the federal hiring process. A recent executive branch report also discussed challenges associated with the cybersecurity workforce. Specifically, in response to Executive Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS led an interagency working group exploring how to support the growth and sustainment of future cybersecurity employees in the public and private sectors. In May 2018, the departments issued a report that identified key findings, including: the U.S. cybersecurity workforce needs immediate and sustained improvements; the pool of cybersecurity candidates needs to be expanded through retraining and by increasing the participation of women, minorities, and veterans; a shortage exists of cybersecurity teachers at the primary and secondary levels, faculty in higher education, and training instructors; and comprehensive and reliable data about cybersecurity workforce position needs and education and training programs are lacking. The report also included recommendations and proposed actions to address the findings, including that private and public sectors should (1) align education and training with employers\u2019 cybersecurity workforce needs by applying the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Cybersecurity Workforce Framework; (2) develop cybersecurity career model paths; and (3) establish a clearinghouse of information on cybersecurity workforce development education, training, and workforce development programs and initiatives. In addition, in June 2018, the executive branch issued a government reform plan and reorganization recommendations that included, among other things, proposals for solving the federal cybersecurity workforce shortage. In particular, the plan notes that the administration intends to prioritize and accelerate ongoing efforts to reform the way that the federal government recruits, evaluates, selects, pays, and places cyber talent across the enterprise. The plan further states that, by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, all CFO Act agencies, in coordination with DHS and OMB, are to develop a critical list of vacancies across their organizations. Subsequently, OMB and DHS are to analyze these lists and work with OPM to develop a government-wide approach to identifying or recruiting new employees or reskilling existing employees. Regarding cybersecurity training, the plan notes that OMB is to consult with DHS to standardize training for cybersecurity employees, and should work to develop an enterprise-wide training process for government cybersecurity employees. For more information on this action area, see appendix IV. Ensure the security of emerging technologies. As the devices used in daily life become increasingly integrated with technology, the risk to sensitive data and PII also grows. Over the last several years, we have reported on weaknesses in addressing vulnerabilities associated with emerging technologies, including: IoT devices, such as fitness trackers, cameras, and thermostats, that continuously collect and process information are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks; IoT devices, such as those acquired and used by DOD employees or that DOD itself acquires (e.g., smartphones), may increase the security risks to the department; vehicles that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attack through technology, such as Bluetooth; the unknown impact of artificial intelligence cybersecurity; and advances in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Executive branch agencies have also highlighted the challenges associated with ensuring the security of emerging technologies. Specifically, in a May 2018 report issued in response to Executive Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS issued a report on the opportunities and challenges in reducing the botnet threat. The opportunities and challenges are centered on six principal themes, including the global nature of automated, distributed attacks; effective tools; and awareness and education. The report also provides recommended actions, including that federal agencies should increase their understanding of what software components have been incorporated into acquired products and establish a public campaign to support awareness of IoT security. For more information on this action area, see appendix V. In our previously discussed reports related to this cybersecurity challenge, we made a total of 50 recommendations to federal agencies to address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 48 recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include 8 priority recommendations, meaning that we believe that they warrant priority attention from heads of key departments and agencies. These priority recommendations include addressing weaknesses associated with, among other things, agency-specific cybersecurity workforce challenges and agency responsibilities for supporting mitigation of vehicle network attacks. Until our recommendations are fully implemented, federal agencies may be limited in their ability to provide effective oversight of critical government-wide initiatives, address challenges with cybersecurity workforce management, and better ensure the security of emerging technologies. In addition to our prior work related to the federal government\u2019s efforts to establish key strategy documents and implement effective oversight, we also have several ongoing reviews related to this challenge. These include reviews of: the CFO Act agencies\u2019 efforts to submit complete and reliable baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces; the extent to which DOD has established training standards for cyber mission force personnel, and efforts the department has made to achieve its goal of a trained cyber mission force; and selected agencies\u2019 ability to implement cloud service technologies and notable benefits this might have on agencies. The federal government has been challenged in securing federal systems and information. Specifically, we have reported that federal agencies have experienced challenges in implementing government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, addressing weaknesses in their information systems and responding to cyber incidents on their systems. This is particularly concerning given that the emergence of increasingly sophisticated threats and continuous reporting of cyber incidents underscores the continuing and urgent need for effective information security. As such, it is important that federal agencies take appropriate steps to better ensure they have effectively implemented programs to protect their information and systems. We have identified three actions that the agencies can take. Improve implementation of government-wide cybersecurity initiatives. Specifically, in January 2016, we reported that DHS had not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to intrusion detection and prevention, information sharing, and analytics. In addition, in February 2017, we reported that the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center\u2019s (NCCIC) functions were not being performed in adherence with the principles set forth in federal laws. We noted that, although NCCIC was sharing information about cyber threats in the way it should, the center did not have metrics to measure that the information was timely, relevant and actionable, as prescribed by law. For more information on this action area, see appendix VI. Address weaknesses in federal information security programs. We have previously identified a number of weaknesses in agencies\u2019 protection of their information and information systems. For example, over the past 2 years, we have reported that: most of the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act had weaknesses in each of the five major categories of information system controls (i.e., access controls, configuration management controls, segregation of duties, contingency planning, and agency-wide security management); three agencies\u2014the Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Food and Drug Administration\u2014had not effectively implemented aspects of their information security programs, which resulted in weaknesses in these agencies\u2019 security controls; information security weaknesses in selected high-impact systems at four agencies\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014were cited as a key reason that the agencies had not effectively implemented elements of their information security programs; DOD\u2019s process for monitoring the implementation of cybersecurity guidance had weaknesses and resulted in the closure of certain tasks (such as completing cyber risk assessments) before they were fully implemented; and agencies had not fully defined the role of their Chief Information Security Officers, as required by FISMA. We also recently testified that, although the government had acted to protect federal information systems, additional work was needed to improve agency security programs and cyber capabilities. In particular, we noted that further efforts were needed by agencies to implement our prior recommendations in order to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. For more information on this action area, see appendix VII. Enhance the federal response to cyber incidents. We have reported that certain agencies have had weaknesses in responding to cyber incidents. For example, as of August 2017, OPM had not fully implemented controls to address deficiencies identified as a result of its 2015 cyber incidents; DOD had not identified the National Guard\u2019s cyber capabilities (e.g., computer network defense teams) or addressed challenges in its exercises; as of April 2016, DOD had not identified, clarified, or implemented all components of its support of civil authorities during cyber incidents; and as of January 2016, DHS\u2019s NCPS had limited capabilities for detecting and preventing intrusions, conducting analytics, and sharing information. For more information on this action area, see appendix VIII. In the public versions of the reports previously discussed for this challenge area, we made a total of 101 recommendations to federal agencies to address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 61 recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include 14 priority recommendations to address weaknesses associated with, among other things, the information security programs at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, OPM, and the Security Exchange Commission. Until these recommendations are implemented, these federal agencies will be limited in their ability to ensure the effectiveness of their programs for protecting information and systems. In addition to our prior work, we also have several ongoing reviews related to the federal government\u2019s efforts to protect its information and systems. These include reviews of: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) implementation, including an assessment of the implementation of the program\u2019s authorization process for protecting federal data in cloud environments; the Equifax data breach, including an assessment of federal oversight of credit reporting agencies\u2019 collection, use, and protection of consumer PII; the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s Electronic Comment Filing System security, to include a review of the agency\u2019s detection of and response to a May 2017 incident that reportedly impacted the system; DOD\u2019s efforts to improve the cybersecurity of its major weapon DOD\u2019s whistleblower program, including an assessment of the policies, procedures, and controls related to the access and storage of sensitive and classified information needed for the program; IRS\u2019s efforts to (1) implement security controls and the agency\u2019s information security program, (2) authenticate taxpayers, and (3) secure tax information; and the federal approach and strategy to securing agency information systems, to include federal intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and the intrusion assessment plan. The federal government has been challenged in working with the private sector to protect critical infrastructure. This infrastructure includes both public and private systems vital to national security and other efforts, such as providing the essential services that underpin American society. As the cybersecurity threat to these systems continues to grow, federal agencies have millions of sensitive records that must be protected. Specifically, this critical infrastructure threat could have national security implications and more efforts should be made to ensure that it is not breached. To help address this issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the cybersecurity framework\u2014a voluntary set of cybersecurity standards and procedures for industry to adopt as a means of taking a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity. However, additional action is needed to strengthen the federal role in protecting the critical infrastructure. Specifically, we have reported on other critical infrastructure protection issues that need to be addressed. For example: DHS did not track vulnerability reduction from the implementation and verification of planned security measures at the high-risk chemical facilities that engage with the department, as a basis for assessing performance. Entities within the 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported encountering four challenges to adopting the cybersecurity framework, such as being limited in their ability to commit necessary resources towards framework adoption and not having the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively implement the framework. DOD and the Federal Aviation Administration identified a variety of operations and physical security risks that could adversely affect DOD missions. Major challenges existed to securing the electricity grid against cyber threats. These challenges included monitoring implementation of cybersecurity standards, ensuring security features are built into smart grid systems, and establishing metrics for cybersecurity. DHS and other agencies needed to enhance cybersecurity in the maritime environment. Specifically, DHS did not include cyber risks in its risk assessments that were already in place nor did it address cyber risks in guidance for port security plans. Sector-specific agencies were not properly addressing progress or metrics to measure their progress in cybersecurity. For more information on this action area, see appendix IX. We made a total of 21 recommendations to federal agencies to address these weaknesses and others. These recommendations include, for example, a total of 9 recommendations to 9 sector-specific agencies to develop methods to determine the level and type of cybersecurity framework adoption across their respective sectors. As of August 2018, all 21 recommendations had not been implemented. Until these recommendations are implemented, the federal government will continue to be challenged in fulfilling its role in protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. In addition to our prior work related to the federal government\u2019s efforts to protect critical infrastructure, we also have several ongoing reviews focusing on: the physical and cybersecurity risks to pipelines across the country responsible for transmitting oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquids; the cybersecurity risks to the electric grid; and the privatization of utilities at DOD installations. The federal government has been challenged in protecting privacy and sensitive data. Advances in technology, including powerful search technology and data analytics software, have made it easy to correlate information about individuals across large and numerous databases, which have become very inexpensive to maintain. In addition, ubiquitous Internet connectivity has facilitated sophisticated tracking of individuals and their activities through mobile devices such as smartphones and fitness trackers. Given that access to data is so pervasive, personal privacy hinges on ensuring that databases of PII maintained by government agencies or on their behalf are protected both from inappropriate access (i.e., data breaches) as well as inappropriate use (i.e., for purposes not originally specified when the information was collected). Likewise, the trend in the private sector of collecting extensive and detailed information about individuals needs appropriate limits. The vast number of individuals potentially affected by data breaches at federal agencies and private sector entities in recent years increases concerns that PII is not being properly protected. Federal agencies should take two types of actions to address this challenge area. In addition, we have previously proposed two matters for congressional consideration aimed toward better protecting PII. Improve federal efforts to protect privacy and sensitive data. We have issued several reports noting that agencies had deficiencies in protecting privacy and sensitive data that needed to be addressed. For example: The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and external entities were at risk of compromising Medicare Beneficiary Data due to a lack of guidance and proper oversight. The Department of Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid had not properly overseen its school partners\u2019 records or information security programs. HHS had not fully addressed key security elements in its guidance for protecting the security and privacy of electronic health information. CMS had not fully protected the privacy of users\u2019 data on state- based marketplaces. Poor planning and ineffective monitoring had resulted in the unsuccessful implementation of government initiatives aimed at eliminating the unnecessary collection, use, and display of SSNs. For more information on this action area, see appendix X. Appropriately limit the collection and use of personal information and ensure that it is obtained with appropriate knowledge or consent. We have issued a series of reports that highlight a number of the key concerns in this area. For example: The emergence of IoT devices can facilitate the collection of information about individuals without their knowledge or consent; Federal laws for smartphone tracking applications have not generally been well enforced; The FBI has not fully ensured privacy and accuracy related to the use of face recognition technology. For more information on this action area, see appendix XI. We have previously suggested that Congress consider amending laws, such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002, because they may not consistently protect PII. Specifically, we found that while these laws and guidance set minimum requirements for agencies, they may not consistently protect PII in all circumstances of its collection and use throughout the federal government and may not fully adhere to key privacy principles. However, revisions to the Privacy Act and the E-Government Act have not yet been enacted. Further, we also suggested that Congress consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework and review issues such as the adequacy of consumers\u2019 ability to access, correct, and control their personal information; and privacy controls related to new technologies such as web tracking and mobile devices. However, these suggested changes have not yet been enacted. We also made a total of 29 recommendations to federal agencies to address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 28 recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include 6 priority recommendations to address weaknesses associated with, among other things, publishing privacy impact assessments and improving the accuracy of the FBI\u2019s face recognition services. Until these recommendations are implemented, federal agencies will be challenged in their ability to protect privacy and sensitive data and ensure that its collection and use is appropriately limited. In addition to our prior work, we have several ongoing reviews related to protecting privacy and sensitive data. These include reviews of: IRS\u2019s taxpayer authentication efforts, including what steps the agency is taking to monitor and improve its authentication methods; the extent to which the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid\u2019s policies and procedures for overseeing non-school partners\u2019 protection of federal student aid data align with federal requirements and guidance; data security issues related to credit reporting agencies, including a review of the causes and impacts of the August 2017 Equifax data breach; the extent to which Equifax assessed, responded to, and recovered from its August 2017 data breach; federal agencies\u2019 efforts to remove PII from shared cyber threat indicators; and how the federal government has overseen Internet privacy, including the roles of the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, and strengths and weaknesses of the current oversight authorities. In conclusion, since 2010, we have made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing the four cybersecurity challenges. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because many of these recommendations have not been implemented. Of the roughly 3,000 recommendations made since 2010, nearly 1,000 had not been implemented as of August 2018. We have also designated 35 as priority recommendations, and as of August 2018, 31 had not been implemented. The federal government and the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are dependent on IT systems and electronic data, which make them highly vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Specifically, the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the protection of cyber critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect individual\u2019s privacy and PII. Until our recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges we identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist.

Federal law and policy call for a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity within the government, as well as globally. We have previously reported that the federal government has faced challenges in establishing a comprehensive strategy to provide a framework for how the United States will engage both domestically and internationally on cybersecurity related matters. More specifically, in February 2013, we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy-related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the private sector; however, no overarching cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set time frames for their completion. Accordingly, we recommended that the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator in the Executive Office of the President develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that included all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy including, among other things, milestones and performance measures for major activities to address stated priorities; cost and resources needed to accomplish stated priorities; and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy\u2019s stated priorities. In response to our recommendation, in October 2015, the Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer, issued a Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The plan also identified key milestones for major activities, resources needed to accomplish milestones, and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy\u2019s milestones. Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. Table 1 identifies these recent efforts and a description of their related contents. These efforts provide a good foundation toward establishing a more comprehensive strategy, but more effort is needed to address all of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we recommended. The recently issued executive branch strategy documents did not include key elements of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy as guidance for decision makers in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. Specifically: Milestones and performance measures to gauge results were generally not included in strategy documents. For example, although the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy stated that its implementation would be assessed on an annual basis, it did not describe the milestones and performance measures for tracking the effectiveness of the activities intended to meet the stated goals (e.g., protecting critical infrastructure and responding effectively to cyber incidents). Without such performance measures, DHS will lack a means to ensure that the goals and objectives discussed in the document are accomplished and that responsible parties are held accountable. According to officials from DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, the department is developing a plan for implementing the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy and expects to issue the plan by the end of calendar year 2018. The officials stated that the plan is expected to identify milestones, roles, and responsibilities across DHS to inform the prioritization of future efforts. The strategy documents generally did not include information regarding the resources needed to carry out the goals and objectives. For example, although the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy identified a variety of actions the agency planned to take to perform their cybersecurity mission, it did not articulate the resources needed to carry out these actions and requirements. Without information on the specific resources needed, federal agencies may not be positioned to allocate such resources and investments and, therefore, may be hindered in their ability meet national priorities. Most of the strategy documents lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities for key agencies, such as DHS, DOD, and OMB. These agencies contribute substantially to the nation\u2019s cybersecurity programs. For example, although the National Security Strategy discusses multiple priority actions needed to address the nation\u2019s cybersecurity challenges (e.g., building defensible government networks, and deterring and disrupting malicious cyber actors), it does not describe the roles, responsibilities, or the expected coordination of any specific federal agencies, including DHS, DOD, or OMB, or other non-federal entities needed to carry out those actions. Without this information, the federal government may not be able foster effective coordination, particularly where there is overlap in responsibilities, or hold agencies accountable for carrying out planned activities. Ultimately, a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening persistent weaknesses. The exploitation of information technology (IT) products and services through the supply chain is an emerging threat. IT supply chain-related threats can be introduced in the manufacturing, assembly, and distribution of hardware, software, and services. Moreover, these threats can appear at each phase of the system development life cycle, when an agency initiates, develops, implements, maintains, and disposes of an information system. As a result, the compromise of an agency\u2019s IT supply chain can degrade the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its critical and sensitive networks, IT-enabled equipment, and data. Federal regulation and guidance issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) set requirements and best practices for mitigating supply chain risks. The Federal Acquisition Regulation established codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by all executive branch agencies. Agencies are required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation to ensure that contracts include quality requirements that are determined necessary to protect the government\u2019s interest. In addition, the NIST guidance on supply chain risk management practices for federal information systems and organizations intends to assist federal agencies with identifying, assessing, and mitigating information and communications technology supply chain risks at all levels of their organizations. We have previously reported on risks to the IT supply chain and risks originating from foreign-manufactured equipment. For example: In July 2018, we testified that if global IT supply chain risks are realized, they could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists for serious adverse impact on an agency\u2019s operations, assets, and employees. We further stated that in 2012 we determined that four national security-related agencies\u2014the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. We recommended that three agencies take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The agencies generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation. In July 2017, we reported that, based on a review of a sample of organizations within the Department of State\u2019s telecommunications supply chain, we were able to identify instances in which device manufacturers, software developers and contractor support were reported to be headquartered in a leading cyber-threat nation. For example, of the 52 telecommunications device manufacturers and software developers in our sample, we were able to identify 12 that had 1 or more suppliers that were reported to be headquartered in a leading cyber-threat nation. We noted that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal agencies, including insertion of counterfeits, tampering, or installation of malicious software or hardware. Figure 5 illustrates possible manufacturing locations of typical network components. Although federal agencies have taken steps to address IT supply chain deficiencies that we previously identified, this area continues to be a potential threat vector for malicious actors to target the federal government. For example, in September 2017, DHS issued a binding operating directive which calls on departments and agencies to identify any use or presence of Kaspersky products on their information systems and to develop detailed plans to remove and discontinue present and future use of the products. DHS expressed concern about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks. On May 11, 2017, the President issued an executive order on strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order makes it the policy of the United States to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cybersecurity and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace. It directed the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with other federal agencies, to assess the scope and sufficiency of efforts to educate and train the American cybersecurity workforce of the future, including cybersecurity- related education curricula, training, and apprenticeship programs, from primary through higher education. Nevertheless, the federal government continues to face challenges in addressing the nation\u2019s cybersecurity workforce. Agencies had not effectively conducted baseline assessments of their cybersecurity workforce or fully developed procedures for coding positions. In June 2018, we reported that 21 of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s Act had conducted and submitted to Congress a baseline assessment identifying the extent to which their cybersecurity employees held professional certifications, as required by the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015. However, we found that the results of these assessments may not have been reliable because agencies did not address all of the reportable information and agencies were limited in their ability to obtain complete and consistent information about their cybersecurity employees and the certifications they held. We determined that this was because agencies had not yet fully identified all members of their cybersecurity workforces or did not have a consistent list of appropriate certifications for cybersecurity positions. Further, 23 of the agencies reviewed had established procedures for identifying and assigning the appropriate employment codes to their civilian cybersecurity positions, as called for by the act. However, 6 of the 23 did not address one or more of 7 activities required by OPM in their procedures, such as reviewing all filled and vacant positions and annotating reviewed position descriptions with the appropriate employment code. Accordingly, we made 30 recommendations to 13 agencies to fully implement two of the act\u2019s requirements on baseline assessments and coding procedures. The extent to which these agencies agreed with the recommendations varied. DHS and the Department of Defense (DOD) had not addressed cybersecurity workforce management requirements set forth in federal laws. In February 2018, we reported that, while DHS had taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014, its actions were not timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS had not yet completed its efforts to identify all of its cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. Table 2 shows DHS\u2019s progress in implementing the requirements of the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014, as of December 2017. Accordingly, we recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed. DHS agreed with our six recommendations, but had not implemented them as of August 2018. Regarding DOD, in November 2017, we reported that instead of developing a comprehensive plan for U.S. Cyber Command, the department submitted a report consisting of a collection of documents that did not fully address the required six elements set forth in Section 1648 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. More specifically, DOD\u2019s 1648 report did not address an element related to cyber incident training. In addition to not addressing the training element in the report, DOD had not ensured that staff were trained as required by the Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination or DOD\u2019s Significant Cyber Incident Coordination Procedures. Accordingly, we made two recommendations to DOD to address these issues. DOD agreed with one of the recommendations and partially agreed with the other, citing ongoing activities related to cyber incident coordination training it believed were sufficient. However, we continued to believe the recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, both recommendations had not yet been implemented. Agencies had not identified and closed cybersecurity skills gaps. In November 2016, we reported that five selected agencies had made mixed progress in assessing their information technology (IT) skill gaps. These agencies had started focusing on identifying cybersecurity staffing gaps, but more work remained in assessing competency gaps and in broadening the focus to include the entire IT community. Accordingly, we made a total of five recommendations to the agencies to address these issues. Four agencies agreed and one, DOD, partially agreed with our recommendations citing progress made in improving its IT workforce planning. However, we continued to believe our recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, all five of the recommendations had not been implemented. Agencies had been challenged with recruiting and retaining qualified staff. In August 2016, we reported on the current authorities chief information security officers (CISO) at 24 agencies. Among other things, CISOs identified key challenges they faced in fulfilling their responsibilities. Several of these challenges were related to the cybersecurity workforce, such as not having enough personnel to oversee the implementation of the number and scope of security requirements. In addition, CISOs stated that they were not able to offer salaries that were competitive with the private sector for candidates with high-demand technical skills. Furthermore, CISOs stated that certain security personnel lacked the skill sets needed or were not sufficiently trained. To assist CISOs in carrying out their responsibilities and better define their roles, we made a total of 34 recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and 13 agencies in our review. Agency responses to the recommendations varied; as of August 2018, 18 of the 34 recommendations had not been implemented. Agencies have had difficulty navigating the federal hiring process. In August 2016, we reported on the extent to which federal hiring authorities were meeting agency needs. Although competitive hiring has been the traditional method of hiring, agencies can use additional hiring authorities to expedite the hiring process or achieve certain public policy goals. Among other things, we noted that agencies rely on a relatively small number of hiring authorities (as established by law, executive order, or regulation) to fill the vast majority of hires into the federal civil service. Further, while OPM collects a variety of data to assess the federal hiring process, neither it nor agencies used this information to assess the effectiveness of hiring authorities. Conducting such assessments would be a critical first step in making more strategic use of the available hiring authorities to more effectively meet their hiring needs. Accordingly, we made three recommendations to OPM to work with agencies to strengthen hiring efforts. OPM generally agreed with the recommendations; however, as of August 2018, two of them had not been implemented. The emergence of new technologies can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities for those technologies which were previous unknown. As we have previously reported, additional processes and controls will need to be developed to potentially address these new vulnerabilities. While some progress has been made to address the security and privacy issues associated with these technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicle networks, there is still much work to be done. For example: IoT devices that continuously collect and process information are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In May 2017, we reported that the IoT has become increasingly used to communicate and process vast amounts of information using \u201csmart\u201d devices (such as fitness trackers, cameras, and thermostats). However, we noted that this emerging technology also presents new issues in areas such as information security, privacy, and safety. For example, IoT devices, networks, or the cloud servers where they store data can be compromised in a cyberattack. Table 3 provides examples of cyber- attacks that could affect IoT devices and networks. IoT devices may increase the security risks to federal agencies. In July 2017, we reported that IoT devices, such as those acquired and used by Department of Defense (DOD) employees or that DOD itself acquires (e.g., smartphones), may increase the security risks to the department. We noted that these risks can be divided into two categories, risks with the devices themselves, such as limited encryption, and risks with how they are used, such as unauthorized communication of information. The department has also identified notional threat scenarios, based on input from multiple DOD entities, which exemplify how these security risks could adversely impact DOD operations, equipment, or personnel. Figure 6 highlights a few examples of these scenarios. In addition, we reported that DOD had started to examine the security risks of IoT devices, but that the department had not conducted required assessments related to the security of its operations. Further, DOD had issued policies and guidance for these devices, but these did not clearly address all of the risks relating to these devices. To address these issues, we made two recommendations to DOD. The department agreed with our recommendations; however, as of August 2018, they had not yet been implemented. Vehicles are potentially susceptible to cyber-attack through networks, such as Bluetooth. In March 2016, we reported that many stakeholders in the automotive industry acknowledge that in-vehicle networks pose a threat to the safety of the driver, as an external attacker could gain control to critical systems in the car. Further, these industry stakeholders agreed that critical systems and other vehicle systems, such as a Bluetooth connection, should be separate in-vehicle networks so they could not communicate or interfere with one another. Figure 7 identifies the key interfaces that could be exploited in a vehicle cyber-attack. To enhance the Department of Transportation\u2019s ability to effectively respond in the event of a real-world vehicle cyberattack, we made one recommendation to the department to better define its roles and responsibilities. The department agreed with the recommendation but, as of August 2018, had not yet taken action to implement it. Artificial intelligence holds substantial promise for improving cybersecurity, but also posed new risks. In March 2018, we reported on the results of a forum we convened to discuss emerging opportunities, challenges, and implications associated with artificial intelligence. At the forum, participants from industry, government, academia, and nonprofit organizations discussed the potential implications of this emerging technology, including assisting with cybersecurity by helping to identify and patch vulnerabilities and defending against attacks; creating safer automated vehicles; improving the criminal justice system\u2019s allocation of resources; and improving how financial services govern investments. However, forum participants also highlighted a number of challenges and risks related to artificial intelligence. For example, if the data used by artificial intelligence are biased or become corrupted by hackers, the results could be biased or cause harm. Moreover, the collection and sharing of data needed to train artificial intelligence systems, a lack of access to computing resources, and adequate human capital were also challenges facing the development of artificial intelligence. Finally, forum participants noted that the widespread adoption raises questions about the adequacy of current laws and regulations. Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative to traditional government-issued currencies, but have security implications. In February 2018, we reported on trends affecting government and society, including the increased use of cryptocurrencies\u2014digital representations of value that are not government-issued\u2014that operate online and verify transactions using a public ledger called blockchain. We highlighted the potential benefits of this technology, such as anonymity and lower transaction costs, as well as drawbacks, including making it harder to detect money laundering and other financial crimes. Because of these capabilities and others, we noted the potential for virtual currencies and blockchain technology to reshape financial services and affect the security of critical financial infrastructures. Lastly, we pointed out that the use of blockchain technology could have more security vulnerabilities as computing power increases as a result of new advancements in quantum computing, an area of quantum information science. In January 2008, the President issued National Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23. The directive established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, a set of projects with the objective of safeguarding federal executive branch government information systems by reducing potential vulnerabilities, protecting against intrusion attempts, and anticipating future threats against the federal government\u2019s networks. Under the initiative, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was to lead several projects to better secure civilian federal government networks. Specifically, the agency established the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which functions as the 24/7 cyber monitoring, incident response, and management center. Figure 8 depicts the Watch Floor, which functions as a national focal point of cyber and communications incident integration. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), one of several subcomponents of the NCCIC, is responsible for operating the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which provides intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to entities across the federal government. Although DHS is fulfilling its statutorily required mission by establishing the NCCIC and managing the operation of NCPS, we have identified challenges in the agency\u2019s efforts to manage these programs: DHS had not ensured that NCPS has fully satisfied all intended system objectives. In January 2016, we reported that NCPS had a limited ability to detect intrusions across all types of network types. In addition, we reported that the system\u2019s intrusion prevention capability was limited and its information-sharing capability was not fully developed. Furthermore, we reported that DHS\u2019s current metrics did not comprehensively measure the effectiveness of NCPS. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS to address these issues and others. The department agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to address one of them. However, as of August 2018, eight of these recommendations had not been implemented. DHS had been challenged in measuring how the NCCIC was performing its functions in accordance with mandated implementing principles. In February 2017, we reported instances where, with certain products and services, NCCIC had implemented its functions in adherence with one or more of its principles, as required by the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 and Cybersecurity Act of 2015. For example, consistent with the principle that it seek and receive appropriate consideration from industry sector-specific, academic, and national laboratory expertise, NCCIC coordinated with contacts from industry, academia, and the national laboratories to develop and disseminate vulnerability alerts. However, we also identified instances where the cybersecurity functions were not performed in adherence with the principles. For example, NCCIC is to provide timely technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities to federal and nonfederal entities, but it had not established measures or other procedures for ensuring the timeliness of these assessments. Further, we reported that NCCIC faces impediments to performing its cybersecurity functions more efficiently, such as tracking security incidents and working across multiple network platforms. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS related to implementing the requirements identified in the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015. The department agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to address two of them. However, as of August 2018, the remaining seven recommendations had not been implemented. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires federal agencies in the executive branch to develop, document, and implement an information security program and evaluate it for effectiveness. The act retains many of the requirements for federal agencies\u2019 information security programs previously set by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. These agency programs should include periodic risk assessments; information security policies and procedures; plans for protecting the security of networks, facilities, and systems; security awareness training; security control assessments; incident response procedures; a remedial action process, and continuity plans and procedures. In addition, Executive Order 13800 states that the President will hold agency heads accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises. In addition, according to the order, it is the policy of the United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise because risk management decisions made by agency heads can affect the risk to the executive branch as a whole, and to national security. Over the past several years, we have performed numerous security control audits to determine how well agencies are managing information security risk to federal information systems and data through the implementation of effective security controls. These audits have resulted in the identification of hundreds of deficiencies related to agencies\u2019 implementation of effective security controls. Accordingly, we provided agencies with limited official use only reports identifying technical security control deficiencies for their respective agency. In these reports, we made hundreds of recommendations related to improving agencies\u2019 implementation of those security control deficiencies. In addition to systems and networks maintained by federal agencies, it is also important that agencies ensure the security of federal information systems operated by third party providers, including cloud service providers. Cloud computing is a means for delivering computing services via information technology networks. Since 2009, the government has encouraged agencies to use cloud-based services to store and process data as a cost-savings measure. In this regard, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to provide a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP is intended to ensure that cloud computing services have adequate information security, eliminate duplicative efforts, and reduce costs. Although there are requirements and government-wide programs to assist with ensuring the security of federal information systems maintained by federal agencies and third party providers, we have identified weaknesses in agencies\u2019 implementation of information security programs. Federal agencies continued to experience weaknesses in protecting their information and information systems due to ineffective implementation of information security policies and practices. In September 2017, we reported that most of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act had weaknesses in each of the five major categories of information system controls (i.e., access controls, configuration management controls, segregation of duties, contingency planning, and agency-wide security management). Weaknesses in these security controls indicate that agencies did not adequately or effectively implement information security policies and practices during fiscal year 2016. Figure 9 identifies the number of agencies with information security weaknesses in each of the five categories. In addition, we found that several agencies had not effectively implemented some aspects of its information security program, which resulted in weaknesses in these agencies\u2019 security controls. In July 2017, we reported that the Security Exchange Commission did not always keep system security plans complete and accurate or fully implement continuous monitoring, as required by agency policy. We made two recommendations to the Security Exchange Commission to effectively manage its information security program. The agency agreed with our recommendations; however, as of August 2018, they had not been implemented. In another July 2017 report, we noted that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not effectively support a risk-based decision to accept system deficiencies; fully develop, document, or update information security policies and procedures; update system security plans to reflect changes to the operating environment; perform effective tests and evaluations of policies, procedures, and controls; or address shortcomings in the agency\u2019s remedial process. Accordingly, we made 10 recommendations to IRS to more effectively implement security-related policies and plans. The agency neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations; as of August 2018, all 10 recommendations had not been implemented. In May 2017, we reported that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation did not include all necessary information in procedures for granting access to a key financial application; fully address its Inspector General findings that security control assessments of outsourced service providers had not been completed in a timely manner; fully address key previously identified weaknesses related to establishing agency-wide configuration baselines and monitoring changes to critical server files; or complete actions to address the Inspector General\u2019s finding that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had not ensured that major security incidents are identified and reported in a timely manner. We made one recommendation to the agency to more fully implement its information security program. The agency agreed with our recommendation and has taken steps to implement it. In August 2016, we reported that the Food and Drug Administration did not fully implement certain security practices involved with assessing risks to systems; complete or review security policies and procedures in a timely manner; complete and review system security plans annually; always track and fully train users with significant security responsibilities; fully test controls or monitor them; remediate identified security weaknesses in a timely fashion based on risk; or fully implement elements of its incident response program. Accordingly, we issued 15 recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration to fully implement its agency-wide information security program. The agency agreed with our recommendations. As of August 2018, all 15 recommendations had been implemented. In May 2016, we reported that a key reason for the information security weaknesses in selected high-impact systems at four agencies\u2014National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014was that they had not effectively implemented elements of their information security programs. For example, most of the selected agencies had conducted information security control assessments for systems, but not all assessments were comprehensive. We also reported that remedial action plans developed by the agencies did not include all the required elements, and not all agencies had developed a continuous monitoring strategy. Table 4 identifies the extent to which the selected agencies implemented key aspects of their information security programs. Accordingly, we made 19 recommendations to the four selected agencies to correct these weaknesses. Agency responses to the recommendations varied. Further, as of August 2018, 16 of the 19 recommendations had not been implemented. DOD\u2019s monitoring of progress in implementing cyber strategies varied. In August 2017, we reported that the DOD\u2019s progress in implementing key strategic cybersecurity guidance\u2014the DOD Cloud Computing Strategy, DOD Cyber Strategy, and DOD Cybersecurity Campaign\u2014has varied. More specifically, we determined that the department had implemented the cybersecurity objectives identified in the DOD Cloud Computing Strategy and had made progress in implementing the DOD Cyber Strategy and DOD Cybersecurity Campaign. However, the department\u2019s process for monitoring implementation of the DOD Cyber Strategy had resulted in the closure of tasks as implemented before the tasks were fully implemented. In addition, the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign lacked time frames for completion and a process to monitor progress, which together provide accountability to ensure implementation. We made two recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s process of ensuring its cyber strategies are effectively implemented. The department partially concurred with these recommendations and identified actions it planned to take to address them. We noted that, if implemented, the actions would satisfy the intent of our recommendations. However, as of August 2018, DOD had not yet implemented our recommendations. Agencies had not fully defined the role of their Chief Information Security Officers (CISO), as required by FISMA. In August 2016, we reported that 13 of 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act had not fully defined the role of their CISO. For example, these agencies did not always identify a role for the CISO in ensuring that security controls are periodically tested; procedures are in place for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; or contingency plans and procedures for agency information systems are in place. Thus, we determined that the CISOs\u2019 ability to effectively oversee these agencies\u2019 information security activities can be limited. To assist CISOs in carrying out their responsibilities and better define their roles, we made a total of 34 recommendations to OMB and 13 agencies in our review. Agency responses to the recommendations varied; as of August 2018, 18 of the 34 recommendations had not been implemented. Presidential Policy Directive-41 sets forth principles governing the federal government\u2019s response to any cyber incident, whether involving government or private sector entities. According to the directive, federal agencies shall undertake three concurrent lines of effort when responding to any cyber incident: threat response; asset response; and intelligence support and related activities. In addition, when a federal agency is an affected entity, it shall undertake a fourth concurrent line of effort to manage the effects of the cyber incident on its operations, customers, and workforce. We have reviewed federal agencies\u2019 preparation and response to cyber incidents and have identified the following weaknesses: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had not fully implemented controls to address deficiencies identified as a result of a cyber incident. In August 2017, we reported that OPM did not fully implement the 19 recommendations made by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) after the data breaches in 2015. Specifically, we noted that, after breaches of personnel and background investigation information were reported, US-CERT worked with the agency to resolve issues and develop a comprehensive mitigation strategy. In doing so, US-CERT made 19 recommendations to OPM to help the agency improve its overall security posture and, thus, improve its ability to protect its systems and information from security breaches. In our August 2017 report, we determined that OPM had fully implemented 11 of the 19 recommendations. For the remaining 8 recommendations, actions for 4 were still in progress. For the other 4 recommendations, OPM indicated that it had completed actions to address them, but we noted further improvements were needed. Further, OPM had not validated actions taken to address the recommendations in a timely manner. As a result of our review, we made five other recommendations to OPM to improve its response to cyber incidents. The agency agreed with four of these and partially concurred with the one related to validating its corrective action. The agency did not cite a reason for its partial concurrence and we continued to believe that the recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, three of the five recommendations had not been implemented. The Department of Defense (DOD) had not identified the National Guard\u2019s cyber capabilities (e.g., computer network defense teams) or addressed challenges in its exercises. In September 2016, we reported that DOD had not identified the National Guard\u2019s cyber capabilities or addressed challenges in its exercises. Specifically, DOD had not identified and did not have full visibility into National Guard cyber capabilities that could support civil authorities during a cyber incident because the department has not maintained a database that identifies National Guard cyber capabilities, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. In addition, we identified three types of challenges with DOD\u2019s cyber exercises that could limit the extent to which DOD is prepared to support civilian authorities in a cyber incident: limited access because of classified exercise environments; limited inclusion of other federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners; and inadequate incorporation of joint physical-cyber scenarios. In our September 2016 report, we noted that DOD had not addressed these challenges. Furthermore, we stated that DOD had not addressed its goals by conducting a \u201ctier 1\u201d exercise (i.e., an exercise involving national-level organizations and combatant commanders and staff in highly complex environments), as stated in the DOD Cyber Strategy. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD (1) maintain a database that identifies National Guard cyber capabilities and (2) conduct a tier 1 exercise to prepare its forces in the event of a disaster with cyber effects. The department partially agreed with our recommendations, stating that its current mechanisms and exercises are sufficient to address the issues highlighted in our report. However, we continued to believe the recommendations were valid. As of August 2018, our two recommendations had not been implemented. DOD had not identified, clarified, or implemented all components of its incident response program. In April 2016, we also reported that DOD had not clarified its roles and responsibilities for defense support of civil authorities during cyber incidents. Specifically, we found that DOD\u2019s overarching guidance about how it is to support civil authorities as part of its Defense Support of Civil Authorities mission did not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of key DOD entities, such as DOD components, the supported command, or the dual-status commander, if they are requested to support civil authorities in a cyber incident. Further, we found that, in some cases, DOD guidance provides specific details on other types of Defense Support of Civil Authorities-related responses, such as assigning roles and responsibilities for fire or emergency services support and medical support, but does not provide the same level of detail or assign roles and responsibilities for cyber support. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD issue or update guidance that clarifies DOD roles and responsibilities to support civil authorities in a domestic cyber incident. DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated that the department will issue or update guidance. However, as of August 2018, the department had not implemented our recommendation. DHS\u2019s NCPS had limited capabilities for detecting and preventing intrusions, conducting analytics, and sharing information. In January 2016, we reported that NCPS had a limited ability to detect intrusions across all types of network types. In addition, we reported that the system\u2019s intrusion prevention capability was limited and its information-sharing capability was not fully developed. Furthermore, we reported that DHS\u2019s current metrics did not comprehensively measure the effectiveness of NCPS. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS to address these issues and others. The department agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to address one of them. However, as of August 2018, eight of these recommendations had not been implemented. The nation\u2019s critical infrastructure include both public and private systems vital to national security and other efforts including providing the essential services, such as banking, water, and electricity\u2014that underpin American society. The cyber threat to critical infrastructure continues to grow and represents a national security challenge. To address this cyber risk, the President issued Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 to enhance the security and resilience of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and maintain a cyber environment that promotes safety, security, and privacy. In accordance with requirements in the executive order which were enacted into law in 2014, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facilitated the development of a set of voluntary standards and procedures for enhancing cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. This process, which involved stakeholders from the public and private sectors, resulted in NIST\u2019s Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. The framework is to provide a flexible and risk-based approach for entities within the nation\u2019s 16 critical infrastructure sectors to protect their vital assets from cyber-based threats. Since then, progress has been made to protect the critical infrastructure of the nation but we have reported that challenges to ensure the safety and security of our infrastructure exist. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had not measured the impact of its efforts to support cyber risk reduction for high- risk chemical sector entities. In August 2018, we reported that DHS had strengthened its processes for identifying high-risk chemical facilities and assigning them to tiers under its Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards program. However, we found that DHS\u2019s new performance measure methodology did not measure reduction in vulnerability at a facility resulting from the implementation and verification of planned security measures during the compliance inspection process. We concluded that doing so would provide DHS an opportunity to begin assessing how vulnerability is reduced\u2014and by extension, risk lowered\u2014not only for individual high-risk facilities but for the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program as a whole. We also determined that, although DHS shares some Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program information, first responders and emergency planners may not have all of the information they need to minimize the risk of injury or death when responding to incidents at high-risk facilities. This was due to first responders at the local level not having access or widely using a secure interface that DHS developed (known as the Infrastructure Protection Gateway) to obtain information about high-risk facilities and the specific chemicals they process. To address the weaknesses we identified, we recommended that DHS take actions to (1) measure reduction in vulnerability of high-risk facilities and use that data to assess program performance, and (2) encourage access to and wider use of the Infrastructure Protection Gateway among first responders and emergency planners. DHS concurred with both recommendations and outlined efforts underway or planned to address them. The federal government had identified major challenges to the adoption of the cybersecurity framework. In February 2018, we reported that there were four different challenges to adopting the cybersecurity framework, including limited resources and competing priorities, reported by entities within their sectors. We further reported that none of the 16 sector-specific agencies were measuring the implementation by these entities, nor did they have qualitative or quantitative measures of framework adoption. While research had been done to determine the use of the framework in the sectors, these efforts had yielded no real results for sector wide adoption. We concluded that, until sector-specific agencies understand the use of the framework by the implementing entities, their ability to understand implementation efforts would be limited. Accordingly, we made a total of nine recommendations to nine sector-specific agencies to address these issues. Five agencies agreed with the recommendations, while four others neither agreed nor disagreed; as of August 2018, all five recommendations had not been implemented. Agencies had not addressed risks to their systems and the information they maintain. In January 2018, we reported that the Department of Defense (DOD) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified a variety of operations and physical security risks related to Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out technology that could adversely affect DOD missions. These risks came from information broadcast by the system itself, as well as from potential vulnerabilities to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks, and from the potential divestment of secondary-surveillance radars. However, DOD and FAA had not approved any solutions to address the risks they identified to the system. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD and FAA, among other things, take action to approve one or more solutions to address Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast Out-related security risks. DOD and FAA generally agreed with our recommendations; however, as of August 2018, they had not been implemented. Major challenges existed to securing the electricity grid against cyber threats. In October 2015, we testified on the status of the electricity grid\u2019s cybersecurity, reporting that entities associated with the grid have encountered several challenges. We noted that these challenges included implementation monitoring, built-in security features in smart grid systems, and establishing metrics for cybersecurity. We concluded that continued attention to these issues and cyber threats in general was required to help mitigate these risks to the electricity grid. DHS and other agencies needed to enhance cybersecurity in the maritime environment. In October 2015, we testified on the status of the cybersecurity of our nation\u2019s ports, concluding that steps needed to be taken to enhance their security. Specifically, we noted that DHS needed to include cyber risks in its risk assessments that are already in place as well as addressing cyber risks in guidance for port security plans. We concluded that, until DHS and the other stakeholders take steps to address cybersecurity in the ports, risk of a cyber-attack with serious consequences are increased. Sector-specific agencies were not properly addressing progress or metrics to measure their progress in cybersecurity. In November 2015, we reported that sector-specific agencies were not comprehensively addressing the cyber risk to the infrastructure, as 11 of the 15 sectors had significant cyber risk. Specifically, we noted that these entities had taken actions to mitigate their cyber risk; however, most had not identified incentives to promote cybersecurity in their sectors. We concluded that while the sector-specific agencies have successfully disseminated the information they possess, there was still work to be done to properly measure cybersecurity implementation progress. Accordingly, we made seven recommendations to six agencies to address these issues. Four of these agencies agreed with our recommendation, while two agencies did not comment on the recommendations. As of August 2018, all seven recommendations had not been implemented. Advancements in technology, such as new search technology and data analytics software for searching and collecting information, have made it easier for individuals and organizations to correlate data and track it across large and numerous databases. In addition, lower data storage costs have made it less expensive to store vast amounts of data. Also, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity make it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information pinpointing their locations. the effectiveness of these procedures. Based on a survey of the schools, the majority of the schools had policies in place for records retention but the way these policies were implemented was highly varied for paper and electronic records. We also found that the oversight of the school\u2019s programs was lacking, as Federal Student Aid conducts reviews but does not consider information security as a factor for selecting schools. out provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We made three recommendations to CMS related to defining procedures for overseeing the security of state-based marketplaces and requiring continuous monitoring of state marketplace controls. HHS concurred with our recommendations. As of August 2018, two of the recommendations had not yet been implemented. Poor planning and ineffective monitoring had resulted in the unsuccessful implementation of government initiatives designed to protect federal data. In July 2017, we reported that government initiatives aimed at eliminating the unnecessary collection, use, and display of Social Security numbers (SSN) have had limited success. Specifically, in agencies\u2019 response to our questionnaire on SSN reduction efforts, the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act reported successfully curtailing the collection, use, and display of SSNs. Nevertheless, all of the agencies continued to rely on SSNs for important government programs and systems, as seen in figure 10. Given that access to data is so pervasive, personal privacy hinges on ensuring that databases of personally identifiable information (PII) maintained by government agencies or on their behalf are protected both from inappropriate access (i.e., data breaches) as well as inappropriate use (i.e., for purposes not originally specified when the information was collected). Likewise, the trend in the private sector of collecting extensive and detailed information about individuals needs appropriate limits. The vast number of individuals potentially affected by data breaches at federal agencies and private sector entities in recent years increases concerns that PII is not being properly protected. The emergence of IoT devices can facilitate the collection of information about individuals without their knowledge or consent. In May 2017, we reported that the IoT has become increasingly used to communicate and process vast amounts of information using \u201csmart\u201d devices (such as a fitness tracker connected to a smartphone). However, we noted that this emerging technology also presents new issues in areas such as information security, privacy, and safety. Smartphone tracking apps can present serious safety and privacy risks. In April 2016, we reported on smartphone applications that facilitated the surreptitious tracking of a smartphone\u2019s location and other data. Specifically, we noted that some applications could be used to intercept communications and text messages, essentially facilitating the stalking of others. While it is illegal to use these applications for these purposes, stakeholders differed over whether current federal laws needed to be strengthened to combat stalking. We also noted that stakeholders expressed concerns over what they perceived to be limited enforcement of laws related to tracking apps and stalking. In particular, domestic violence groups stated that additional education of law enforcement officials and consumers about how to protect against, detect, and remove tracking apps is needed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has not ensured privacy and accuracy related to the use of face recognition technology. In May 2016, we reported that the Department of Justice had not been timely in publishing and updating privacy documentation for the FBI\u2019s use of face recognition technology. Publishing such documents in a timely manner would better assure the public that the FBI is evaluating risks to privacy when implementing systems. Also, the FBI had taken limited steps to determine whether the face recognition system it was using was sufficiently accurate. We recommended that the department ensure required privacy-related documents are published and that the FBI test and review face recognition systems to ensure that they are sufficiently accurate. Of the six recommendations we made, the Department of Justice agreed with one, partially agreed with two, and disagreed with three. We continued to believe all the recommendations made were valid. As of August 2018, the six recommendations had not been implemented. In addition to the contacts named above, Jon Ticehurst, Assistant Director; Kush K. Malhotra, Analyst-In-Charge; Chris Businsky; Alan Daigle; Rebecca Eyler; Chaz Hubbard; David Plocher; Bradley Roach; Sukhjoot Singh; Di\u2019Mond Spencer; and Umesh Thakkar made key contributions to this report.",

                "Federal agencies and the nation's critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on information technology systems to carry out operations. The security of these systems and the data they use is vital to public confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings in each of these action areas, including protecting cyber critical infrastructure, managing the cybersecurity workforce, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Although many recommendations have been addressed, about 1,000 have not yet been implemented. Until these shortcomings are addressed, federal agencies' information and systems will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies since 2010 aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings. As of August 2018, about 1,000 still needed to be implemented."

            "context": "The Forest Service\u2019s mission includes sustaining the nation\u2019s forests and grasslands; managing the productivity of those lands for the benefit of citizens; conserving open space; enhancing outdoor recreation opportunities; and conducting research and development in the biological, physical, and social sciences. The agency carries out its responsibilities in three main program areas: (1) managing public lands, known collectively as the National Forest System, through nine regional offices, 154 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and over 600 ranger districts; (2) conducting research through its network of seven research stations, multiple associated research laboratories, and 81 experimental forests and ranges; and (3) working with state and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners and forest users in the management, protection, and development of forest land in nonfederal ownership, largely through its nine regional offices. According to the Forest Service, it employs a workforce of over 30,000 employees across the country. However, this number grows by thousands in the summer months, when the agency hires seasonal employees to conduct fieldwork, respond to wildland fires, and meet the visiting public\u2019s needs. The Office of the Chief of the Forest Service is located in Washington, D.C., with 27 offices reporting directly to the Office of the Chief, as illustrated in figure 1. The nine national forest regions, each led by a regional forester, oversee the national forests and grasslands located in their respective regions. Each national forest or grassland is headed by a supervisor, the seven research stations are each led by a station director, and a state and private forestry area is headed by an area director. The Forest Service collectively refers to its forest regions, research stations, and area as RSAs. The RSAs are organized differently according to their operations, and comparable operations within the RSAs, such as collections from reimbursable agreements, may be processed differently in the various regions and stations, resulting in highly decentralized operations. In addition, the offices of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO); Deputy Chief of Business Operations (includes the budget office); and eight other offices located in the Washington, D.C., headquarters also report directly to the Office of the Chief of the Forest Service. The Forest Service receives appropriations for its various programs and for specific purposes to meet its mission goals. Prior to fiscal year 2017, the Forest Service\u2019s budgetary resources consisted primarily of no-year funds. Its budget office in Washington, D.C., initiates apportionment requests and monitors the receipt of Department of the Treasury (Treasury) warrants. Upon receipt of the warrant, the apportionment is recorded in the financial system and then the budget office develops an allocation summary detailing the allocation of its budget authority by fund, programs within the funds, and distribution of funds at the regional, station, and area levels. The Forest Service may also transfer funds from other appropriations to the appropriations account that funds its fire suppression activities when available funds appropriated for fire suppression and the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) fund will be exhausted within 30 days. The Forest Service\u2019s administrative policies, practices, and procedures are issued in its Directive System, which provides a unified system for issuing, storing, and retrieving internal direction that governs Forest Service programs and activities. The Directive System consists of the Forest Service\u2019s manuals and handbooks. The manuals contain management objectives, policies, and responsibilities and provide general direction to Forest Service line officers and staff directors for planning and executing their assigned programs and activities. The handbooks provide detailed direction to employees and are the principal source of specialized guidance and instruction for carrying out directions issued in the manuals. Line officers at the national and RSA levels have authority to issue directives in the manuals and handbooks under their respective jurisdictions. The Forest Service\u2019s policy states that the Directive System is the only place where Forest Service policy and procedures are issued. In addition to the Directive System, Forest Service staff have also developed standard operating procedures (SOP) and desk guides to supplement guidance provided in directives. However, the SOPs and desk guides are not part of the Forest Service Directive System and therefore are not official policy and procedures. While the Forest Service had documented processes for allotting its budgetary resources, it did not have an adequate process and related control activities for reasonably assuring that (1) amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated and (2) unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need. In addition, the Forest Service did not have a properly designed and documented system for administrative control of funds. Finally, the Forest Service had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers for fire suppression activities under its Wildland Fire Management program. While the Forest Service had documented processes for allotting its budgetary resources, it did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated\u2014as required by the purpose statute, which states that \u201cappropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d We reviewed Forest Service documents about its budget authority processes, which included control objectives, related control activities, and processes over the allotment of its budgetary resources. We found that these documents, including manuals and handbooks, did not include an adequate process and related control activities for assuring that appropriated amounts are used for the purposes designated. For example, such a process would include the Forest Service allotting appropriated funds for specific programs or objects as provided in the applicable appropriation act, by either using specific budget line items already defined in the Forest Service\u2019s financial system or creating new budget line items, as needed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and design appropriate control activities to achieve objectives and respond to the risks identified. As a result of the Forest Service not having an adequate process and related control activities for assuring that appropriated amounts are used for the purposes designated, the Forest Service did not properly allocate certain funds for specific purposes detailed in the appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For example, in fiscal year 2015, the Forest Service did not set aside in its financial system the $65 million specified in the fiscal year 2015 appropriations act for acquiring aircraft for the next- generation airtanker fleet. According to Forest Service documents, as of January 6, 2016, $35 million of the designated funds was used for other purposes. In February 2017, we issued a legal opinion, related to the Forest Service\u2019s use of the $65 million, which concluded that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute. According to USDA\u2019s Office of General Counsel, \u201cthis lack of any separate apportionment or account for the next-generation airtanker fleet was due to the fact that it was a new item, not included in the agency\u2019s budget request, and added late in the appropriations process.\u201d Similarly, in fiscal year 2016, the Forest Service did not create new budget line items to reserve in its financial system $75 million for the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program specified in the fiscal year 2016 appropriations act. Rather than creating a new budget line item for the program specified in the appropriations act, the funds were combined with an existing budget line item, making it difficult to track related budget amounts and actual expenditures. The lack of an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that appropriated amounts are used for the purpose designated also increases the risk that the Forest Service may violate the Antideficiency Act. The Forest Service did not have a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated, no-year funds from prior years were reviewed for continuing need. We reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s budget authority process document and related manuals and handbooks, which documented control objectives and procedures over its budgetary resources and the guidance for administrative control of funds. We found that these documents did not include a process for reviewing the Forest Service\u2019s unobligated, no-year funds from prior years and related control activities to reasonably assure that such funds were reviewed for continuing need. Such reviews, if performed, may identify unneeded funds that could be reallocated to other programs needing additional budgetary resources, if consistent with the purposes designated in appropriations acts. The USDA Budget Manual states as a department policy that \u201cagencies of the Department have a responsibility to review their programs continually and recommend, when appropriate, deferrals or rescissions.\u201d The USDA Budget Manual further states the following: \u201cAgency officials should remain alert to this responsibility since the establishment of reserves is an important phase of budgetary administration. If it becomes evident during the fiscal year that any amount of funds available will not be needed to carry out foreseeable program requirements, it is in the interest of good management to recommend appropriate actions, thereby maintaining a realistic relationship between apportionments, allotments, and obligations.\u201d However, the Forest Service did not develop a directive addressing the control objectives, related risks, and control activities for implementing this USDA policy. Up until fiscal year 2017, Forest Service budgetary resources consisted primarily of no-year funds. At the beginning of each fiscal year, unobligated balances of no-year funds are carried forward and reapportioned to become part of budget authority available for obligation in the new fiscal year. Unobligated balances can increase during the fiscal year due to deobligation of prior years\u2019 unliquidated obligations that the Forest Service determines it no longer needs. These resources are immediately available to the Forest Service to the extent authorized by law without further legislation or action from Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unless the apportionment states otherwise. According to Forest Service officials, unobligated funds reported in the Forest Service\u2019s September 30, 2016, Statement of Budgetary Resources included $351 million in discretionary unobligated no-year funds, appropriated as far back as fiscal year 1999. The Forest Service did not identify and define a process and control objectives related to its review of unobligated no-year funds from prior years for continuing need. As a result, the Forest Service did not have reasonable assurance that prior no-year unobligated balances were properly managed and considered in its annual budget requests. This increased the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Additionally, the Forest Service could miss opportunities to use its prior year unobligated no-year funds more timely and effectively, for example, using these funds for other Forest Service program needs, if consistent with the purposes designated in appropriations acts. During our work, we brought this issue to management\u2019s attention, and in response, Forest Service officials stated that the Forest Service is planning to develop a quarterly process to review available balances and, as needed, redirect funds to agency priorities. However, as of July 2017, the Forest Service had not yet developed this review process. Further, Congress rescinded about $18 million of the Forest Service\u2019s prior year unobligated balances and required it to report unobligated balances quarterly within 30 days after the close of each quarter and appropriated multi-year funds instead of no- year funds to the Forest Service for fiscal year 2017. The Forest Service issued guidance related to administrative control of funds in manuals and handbooks, which USDA did not review and approve prior to their issuance. Based on our review of these documents, we found that the processes and related control activities over the administrative control of funds were dispersed in numerous manuals and handbooks, which may hamper a clear understanding of the overall system. Further, the system lacked key elements that would allow it to serve as an adequate system of administrative control of funds. For example, in its manuals and handbooks the Forest Service did not identify, by title or office, those officials with the authority and responsibility for obligating the service\u2019s appropriated funds, such as funds for contracts, travel, and training. As a result, the responsibility for obligating funds was not clearly described and properly assigned in Forest Service policy as required by the USDA Budget Manual and OMB Circular No. A-11. OMB Circular No. A-11 states that the Antideficiency Act requires that the agency head prescribe, by regulation, a system of administrative control of funds, and OMB provided a checklist in appendix H to the circular that agencies can use for drafting their fund control regulations. This requirement is consistent with those in the USDA Budget Manual, which prescribes budgetary administration through a system of administrative controls for its component agencies, including the Forest Service. The USDA Budget Manual states that to the extent necessary for effective administration, (1) the heads of USDA component agencies may delegate to subordinate officials responsibilities in connection with the administrative distribution of funds within apportionments and allotments and the monitoring, control, and reporting of the occurrence of obligations and expenditures under apportionments and allotments and (2) the chain of such responsibility shall be clearly defined. In addition, USDA requires its component agencies to promulgate and maintain administrative control of funds regulation and to send such regulation to USDA\u2019s Office of Program and Budget Analysis for review and approval prior to issuance. Because the Forest Service has not developed and issued a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds that considers all aspects of the budget execution processes, it cannot reasonably assure that (1) programs will achieve their intended results; (2) the use of resources is consistent with the agency\u2019s mission; (3) programs and resources are protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement; and (4) laws and regulations are followed. We also found that the Forest Service had not reviewed and updated most of its administrative control of funds guidance in the manuals and handbooks for over 5 years. The USDA Budget Manual requires each component to periodically review its funds control system for overall effectiveness and to assure that it is consistent with its agency programs and organizational structures. Further, Forest Service policy also requires routine review, every 5 years, of policies and procedures in its Directive System. According to Forest Service officials, when directives are up for review and update, a staff from the Office of Regulatory and Management Services (ORMS) sends an e-mail reminder to notify responsible personnel that updates to applicable directives are needed. However, we found that the Forest Service does not have adequate controls in place to monitor the reviews and any updates of the manuals and handbooks in its Directive System to reasonably assure that their efforts resulted in timely updates. As a result, the Forest Service is at risk that guidance for its system for administrative control of funds may lose relevance as processes change over time and control activities may become inadequate. The Forest Service did not have properly designed control activities over its process for fund transfers related to wildland fire suppression activities. The Forest Service receives appropriations for necessary expenses for (1) fire suppression activities on National Forest System lands, (2) emergency fire suppression on or adjacent to such lands or other lands under fire protection agreement, (3) hazardous fuels management on or adjacent to such lands, and (4) state and volunteer fire assistance. Transfer of funds from other Forest Service programs to its fire suppression activities occurs when the Forest Service has exhausted all available funds appropriated for the purpose of fire suppression and the FLAME fund. A key aspect of this process is assessing the FLAME forecast, which the Forest Service uses to predict the costs of fighting wildland fires for a given season, and developing a strategy to identify specific programs and the amounts that may be transferred to pay for fire suppression activities when needed. The process for reviewing the FLAME forecast and strategizing the fund transfers was documented in the Basic Budget Desk Guide created by staff in the Forest Service\u2019s Strategic Planning and Budget Analysis Office. However, the desk guide did not contain evidence of review by responsible officials. As a result, the Forest Service lacked reasonable assurance that the desk guide was complete and appropriate for its use. The Basic Budget Desk Guide included a listing of actions to be performed by the analyst for reviewing the FLAME forecast report and developing a strategy for fund transfer from other programs. However, the desk guide did not specify the factors to be considered when developing the strategy. For example, it did not call for documentation addressing the rationale for the strategy or an assessment of the risk that the fund transfer could have on the programs from which the funds would be transferred. The desk guide also did not describe the review and approval of the strategy by a responsible official(s) prior to the fund transfer request sent to the Chief of the Forest Service. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks and that such control activities should be designed at the appropriate levels in the organizational structure. Further, management may design a variety of transaction control activities for operational processes, which may include verifications, authorizations and approvals, and supervisory control activities. The lack of properly designed control activities for supervisory review of the desk guide and strategy to identify the amounts for fund transfers does not provide the Forest Service reasonable assurance that the objectives of the fund transfers\u2014including mitigating the risk of a shortfall of funding for other critical Forest Service program activities, such as payroll or other day-to-day operating costs\u2014will be efficiently and effectively achieved. The Forest Service enters into various reimbursable agreements with agencies within USDA, other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities to carry out its mission for public benefit. The reimbursable agreements may be for the Forest Service to provide goods and services to a third party or to receive goods and services from a third party, or may be a partnership agreement with a third party for a common goal. According to Forest Service officials, the two distinct types of Forest Service reimbursable agreements are (1) fire incident cooperative agreements and (2) reimbursable and advanced collection agreements (RACA). The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations. In addition, processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs were not adequately described in applicable manuals and handbooks in the Directive System, to reasonably assure that control activities could be performed consistently and effectively. Further, certain RACA processes in the Directive System had not been timely reviewed by management and did not reflect current processes. Moreover, as previously discussed, SOPs and desk guides developed in field offices related to RACA processes were not in the Forest Service\u2019s Directive System. Finally, the Forest Service lacked control activities segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers in creating reimbursable agreements and the final disposition of related receivables. The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations and reliable reporting internally and externally. As part of the service\u2019s mission objective to suppress wildland fires, Forest Service officials stated that they enter into 5-year agreements referred to as master cooperative agreements with federal, state, and other entities. These agreements document the framework for commitment and support efficient and effective coordination and cooperation among the parties in suppressing fires, when they occur. The master cooperative agreements do not require specific funding commitments as amounts are not yet known. These agreements vary from region to region because of the differing laws and regulations pertaining to the participating states and other entities. These variations can also result in different billing and collection processes between regions. When a fire occurs, supplemental agreements, which are based on the framework established in the applicable master cooperative agreements, are signed by relevant parties for each fire incident. These agreements establish the share of fire suppression costs incurred by the Forest Service and amounts related to entities that benefitted from those fire suppression efforts. These supplemental agreements require commitment and obligation of funds. As indicated in figure 2, the Forest Service\u2019s obligations for fire suppression activities ranged from $412 million to $1.4 billion over the 10-year period from fiscal years 2007 through 2016. In response to our request for documentation of processes and related control activities over its fire incident cooperative agreements, Forest Service officials stated that processes and related control activities over reimbursable agreements were applicable to both fire incident cooperative agreements and RACAs. However, based on our review of the Forest Service\u2019s processes and related control activities over its reimbursable agreements, we found that the unique features of fire incident cooperative agreements (as compared to features of RACAs) were not addressed in the processes and related controls for reimbursable agreements. For example, there was no process and related control activities over the negotiation and review of (1) a fire incident master cooperative agreement, which is developed before a fire occurs, and (2) supplemental agreements, which are signed by all relevant parties after the start of a fire incident. These supplemental agreements detail, among other things, the terms for (1) fire department resource use, (2) financial arrangements, and (3) specific cost-sharing agreements. Another unique feature of fire incident cooperative agreements, which was not covered in process documents for its reimbursable agreements, was the preparation of the Cost Settlement Package. The preparation of this package does not start until after the fire has ended and the Forest Service has received and paid all bills. According to Forest Service officials, a fire incident is deemed to have ended when there are no more resources (firefighters and equipment) on the ground putting out the fire. However, this definition was not documented in the Forest Service\u2019s manuals and handbooks in the Directive System. Based on our review of documentation that the Forest Service provided for four fire incidents, we found that for these incidents the Cost Settlement Packages and the billings took several months to years to complete after the fire incident. According to Forest Service officials, delays in preparing the Cost Settlement Package in many cases were due to parties involved in suppressing the fires taking a long time to submit their invoices to the Forest Service for payment. Because the preparation of Cost Settlement Packages was not included in the process documents, the Forest Service did not have a defined time frame for when, in relation to the end of the fire, the Cost Settlement Package must be completed. For example, in one case we reviewed, the bill for a cost settlement was sent 9 months after the fire occurred, and in another case, settlement occurred approximately 2 years after the fire occurred. For both fire incidents, based on the reports we reviewed, the fires were contained within a week or two, but the Forest Service does not have a policy for documenting the date when the fire incident is deemed to have ended. Because of the complexity of the process for negotiating and determining the reimbursable amounts from all the costs that the Forest Service pays for a fire incident, the reimbursable amounts may take time to negotiate, and subsequent billing to and collection from parties may take much longer. Forest Service officials stated that some receivables that were not going to be collected until after its financial system\u2019s aging process for receivables deemed such receivables uncollectible and a bad debt are tracked in a spreadsheet outside its financial system. We found that the Forest Service did not have a documented process and related control activities to reasonably assure that its Budget Office was informed of these older receivables being tracked in a spreadsheet and the related progress of collection activities that local program managers and line officers perform, which could affect the reliability of the reported reimbursable receivable amounts. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Without proper communication, important information, such as amounts that the Forest Service will receive from fire incident cost settlement negotiations, may not be considered in the Forest Service\u2019s strategy for the effective and efficient management of fund transfers for fire suppression activities. Processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs were not adequately described in Forest Service manuals and handbooks in its Directive System. RACAs, which may be for research or other nonemergency purposes, are billed and collected based on previously agreed upon billing and collection terms. In accordance with the Forest Service\u2019s Directive System, policies related to business processes, such as RACAs, are documented in its manuals while procedures for performing specialized activities are documented in its handbooks. We found that the manuals and handbooks in the Directive System did not adequately describe the processes and related control activities over the RACA processes to enable efficient and effective performance of the work by appropriate and responsible personnel. The manuals and handbooks related to RACAs state that a manager review the documentation to ensure that the funding supports the objective of the agreement, the agreement is the correct instrument for funding the project, all relevant terms and conditions have been included in the agreement, the entity\u2019s financial strength and capability are acceptable, and all applicable regulations and OMB circulars have been addressed. However, there was no discussion in the manuals and handbooks about when the manager needs to perform the reviews and how these reviews were to be documented. Further, in response to our inquiry regarding procedures performed to assess the entity\u2019s financial strength and capability are acceptable before a RACA is signed, Forest Service officials stated that there is currently no formal process for determining financial capability for RACAs. For reimbursable agreements, the Forest Service\u2019s process documented in its handbook consisted of completing a creditworthiness checklist. However, the handbook did not describe procedures for (1) completing the checklist and (2) documenting responsible personnel\u2019s review and approval of an entity\u2019s acceptable financial capability. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Management\u2019s design of internal control establishes and communicates the who, what, when, where, and why of internal control execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel. Further, the standards also explain that management clearly document internal control in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available and properly managed and maintained. In addition, the manuals and handbooks applicable to the RACAs have not been timely reviewed by management, and had not been updated to reflect current processes. For example, the document that serves as direction for Forest Service personnel on how to enter into RACAs referred to an outdated financial system that was replaced in fiscal year 2013. Further, the manuals and handbooks for the RACA processes had no indication that they had been reviewed within the past 5 years. Forest Service policy requires routine review, every 5 years, of policies and procedures in its Directive System. According to Forest Service officials, a staff member from ORMS sends an e-mail to officials responsible for updating these policies and procedures. However, appropriate control activities have not been designed to reasonably assure that updates were made, reviewed, approved, and issued as needed for continued relevance and effectiveness. Without adequate descriptions of processes and related control activities in its manuals and handbooks over RACAs, the Forest Service is at risk that processes and related control activities may not be properly, consistently, and timely performed. Further, because it lacks a process and related controls for monitoring and reviewing the updates of the guidance and various process documents in the Directive System, the Forest Service is at risk that its policies and procedures may not provide appropriate agency-wide direction in achieving control objectives, particularly when financial systems change and old processes may no longer be applicable. SOPs and desk guides related to RACA processes were not in the Directive System and are not considered official Forest Service policy and procedures. Forest Service field staff responsible for various processes generally developed SOPs and desk guides to document day-to-day procedures for employees in carrying out RACA processes to supplement the manuals and handbooks. However, the SOPs and desk guides did not reference the applicable manuals and handbooks they supplemented. Further, the SOPs and desk guides did not provide descriptions of (1) review procedures for authorization, completeness, and validity of RACAs and related receivables; (2) detailed review procedures to be performed and by whom; (3) timing of review procedures; and (4) how to document the completion of the review procedures. Finally, SOPs and desk guides did not have evidence that responsible officials reviewed and approved them to authorize their use. These SOPs and desk guides are only available in the field office where these were developed, and if similar SOPs and desk guides were developed in other field offices, control activities and how they are performed could vary. We also noted that these SOPs and desk guides were not timely updated to reflect processes and systems currently in use. For example, there were many instances where the SOPs and desk guides referred to systems that the Forest Service no longer used. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Effective documentation assists in management\u2019s design of internal control by establishing and communicating the who, what, when, where, and why of internal control execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel and to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Management assigns responsibility and delegates authority to key roles throughout the entity. As a result of the issues discussed above, the Forest Service is at risk that control activities may not be properly and consistently performed and its related control objectives may not be achieved efficiently and effectively. In addition, the Forest Service is at risk that knowledge for performing the control activities may be limited to a few personnel or lost altogether in the event of employee turnover. The Forest Service lacked control activities over the segregation of incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers for reimbursable agreements and any adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables. Field offices manage the majority of Forest Service projects, including authorizing the agreements and monitoring related collection. The Forest Service line officer for fire incident cooperative agreements and program managers for RACA at the RSA, unit, or field levels initiate and develop the terms of the agreements and are also responsible for any subsequent negotiation of the agreements. In the process of negotiating and settling costs, the line officer or program manager has the authority to cancel or change related receivables that they deemed uncollectible. For example, in a fire incident, the line officer at the region or field level is involved in both developing a Cost Share Agreement and after the fire incident has ended, negotiating the Cost Settlement Package with parties involved in the agreement to determine the final settlement amount that the Forest Service will be reimbursed for expenses paid in suppressing the fire incident. Therefore, the line officer is responsible for initiating the Cost Share Agreement, modifying the Cost Settlement Package, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent conflicting duties. We also found that the Forest Service did not have any mitigating controls, such as independent approval of any adjustments affecting the final disposition of receivables, to mitigate the risk of these incompatible duties. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Segregation of duties contributes to the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of control activities. To achieve segregation of key functions, management can divide responsibilities among different people to reduce the risk of error, misuse, or fraud. This may include separating the responsibilities for authorizing or approving transactions, processing and recording them, and reviewing the transactions so that no one individual controls all key aspects of a transaction or event. Forest Service officials stated they did not consider segregating the conflicting duties related to reimbursable agreements because these line officers and program managers were most familiar with the terms of the agreement and the activities performed. However, a lack of adequate segregation of conflicting duties or proper monitoring and review of conflicting duties for receivables from reimbursable agreements could result in receivables not being collected, and an increased risk of fraud. The Forest Service\u2019s processes and related control activities over review of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure optimum utilization of funds and were inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. Further, Forest Service manuals and handbooks related to the review of unliquidated obligations did not clearly describe control activities and were not timely reviewed by management. The Forest Service reported unliquidated obligations of approximately $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in its financial statements as of September 30, 2015, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, the Forest Service deobligated about $319 million of its unliquidated obligations from prior years. The Forest Service\u2019s procedures related to the review of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed and were inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In accordance with USDA Departmental Regulation (Regulation 2230-001) and related Forest Service policy, the Forest Service identifies and reviews unliquidated obligations that have been inactive for at least 12 months to determine whether delivery or performance of goods or services is still expected to occur. Once a determination has been made that an unliquidated obligation can be deobligated, program or procurement personnel are to notify finance personnel, in writing, within 5 days of the determination to process the deobligation. Within 15 days of receipt of the written notification, the unliquidated obligations are to be adjusted in the financial management system. The Forest Service CFO is then to be notified in writing that the deobligation was processed. Within 1 month of the close of each quarter, the Forest Service CFO is to submit to USDA\u2019s Associate CFO for Financial Operations a certification stating that the Forest Service has performed reviews of its unliquidated obligations and taken appropriate actions, such as promptly deobligating an unliquidated obligation that is no longer needed. However, the Forest Service\u2019s quarterly certifications are inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy because the months included in each quarterly review do not line up with the months outlined in policy. For example, as shown in table 1, based on policy the certification due on October 31, covers the months July through September. However in practice, the certification that the Forest Service prepared for October 31 covers May through July. As a result, the review and certification for August and September would be delayed an entire quarter. According to Forest Service officials, it takes considerable time to produce accurate unliquidated obligations reports from USDA\u2019s financial system and then distribute them to field offices. Therefore, there is not sufficient time for the field offices to review and deobligate amounts not needed from the unliquidated obligations balances to meet USDA\u2019s certification timing and requirements. However, the Forest Service has not developed other processes and control activities that could help meet USDA and Forest Service policy and reasonably assure that unliquidated obligations are reviewed timely and appropriate actions are taken. As a result, there is an increased risk that the Forest Service may not achieve its control objectives of optimum utilization of funds and timely adjustments of obligated balances. The Forest Service\u2019s process and related control activities over its review of unliquidated obligations and resulting certifications were not adequately described in manuals and handbooks in its Directive System. Further, the manuals and handbooks were not timely reviewed and updated to reflect processes and systems currently in use. In accordance with the Forest Service\u2019s Directive System, policies are documented in its manuals while procedures for performing specialized activities are documented in its handbooks. However, we found that the Forest Service\u2019s processes and related control activities for reviewing unliquidated obligations were not adequately described and documented in such manuals and handbooks. Although parts of the applicable section of the handbook referred to procedures, there were no detailed descriptions of the processes, and only references to objectives of the procedures for reviewing unliquidated obligations were listed. For example, in identifying unliquidated obligations for review, the narrative description of the procedures in the handbook states that the responsible obligating official must review each selected unliquidated obligation to determine whether (1) delivery or performance of goods or services has occurred or is expected to occur and (2) accounting corrections to the obligation data in the accounting system are necessary. The handbook also refers to an unliquidated obligations report listing the unliquidated obligations that must be reviewed. The narrative does not provide any detailed procedures that obligating officials or responsible personnel need to perform, how to perform those procedures, and how those control activities are to be documented. The guidance in the handbook was supplemented by two desk guides. However, the desk guides are outside the Forest Service\u2019s Directive System and, as previously noted, the Directive System is the only place where the Forest Service\u2019s policy and procedures are issued. In addition, these desk guides did not reference the applicable guidance in the Directive System that they were supplementing. Further, the process and related control activities for adjusting unliquidated obligations within 15 days of receipt of written notification, as stated in USDA\u2019s policy, were not described in either the handbooks or the desk guides. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks to achieve an effective internal control system. Management\u2019s design of internal control establishes and communicates the who, what, when, where, and why of internal control execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel. Further, the standards also explain that management clearly document internal control in a manner that allows documentation to be readily available and that documentation be properly managed and maintained. In addition, manuals and handbooks for processes related to review and certification of unliquidated obligations had no evidence that they had been reviewed within the past 5 years for ongoing relevance and effectiveness. According to a Forest Service manual, all service-wide directives, except interim directives, shall be reviewed at least once every 5 years. The Forest Service does not have an effective process in place to monitor the reviews and any updates of the manuals and handbooks in its Directive System. As previously discussed, while ORMS sends an e- mail requesting that the applicable officials review and update the guidance in the manuals and handbooks, there is no follow-up process to help ensure that documents were reviewed and updated as needed. Because the Forest Service\u2019s process and related control activities over its review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not adequately described in its manuals and handbooks, the Forest Service is at risk that its control activities may not reasonably assure that control objectives provide (1) optimum utilization of funds and (2) for unliquidated obligations that are no longer needed to be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Adequate processes and related control activities over the Forest Service\u2019s budgetary resources are critical in reasonably assuring that these resources are timely and effectively available for its mission operations, including fire suppression. However, we identified deficiencies in the Forest Service\u2019s processes and related controls over allotments, unobligated no-year funds from prior years, administrative control of funds, fund transfers, reimbursable agreements, and available funds from deobligation of unliquidated obligations. Deficiencies ranged from a lack of processes to control activities that were not properly designed, resulting in an increased risk that Forest Service funds may not be effectively and efficiently monitored and used. In addition, the Forest Service\u2019s manuals and handbooks, which provide the directives for the areas we reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service\u2019s 5-year review policy. Further, Forest Service staff prepared SOPs and desk guides that documented control activities, but they were not issued as official policy and had not been reviewed and approved by responsible officials. As a result, the Forest Service is at increased risk that the control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency and that the guidance in the SOPs and desk guides may not comply with agency policy in the Directive System. To improve internal controls over the Forest Service\u2019s budget execution processes, we are making the following 11 recommendations: The Chief of the Forest Service should (1) revise its process and (2) design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are properly used for the purposes specifically designated. (Recommendation 1) The Chief of the Forest Service should (1) develop a process and (2) design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year funds from prior years are reviewed for continuing need. (Recommendation 2) The Chief of the Forest Service should (1) design, document, and implement a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds and (2) submit it for review and approval by USDA before issuance, as required by the USDA Budget Manual. (Recommendation 3) The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement control activities over the preparation and approval of a fire suppression fund transfers strategy, to specify all appropriate factors to be considered in developing and documenting the strategy, and incorporate these control activities into the Directive System. (Recommendation 4) The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure efficient and effective operations and timely and reliable reporting of reimbursable receivables related to fire incident cooperative agreements, and incorporate them in the Directive System. (Recommendation 5) The Chief of the Forest Service should update the RACA manuals and handbooks to adequately describe the processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs to reasonably assure that staff will know (1) how and when to perform processes and control activities and (2) how to document their performance. (Recommendation 6) The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement segregation of duties or mitigating control activities over reimbursable agreements and any adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables. (Recommendation 7) The Chief of the Forest Service should modify, document, and implement control activities consistent with USDA and Forest Service policy to reasonably assure that unliquidated obligations are reviewed timely and appropriate actions are taken. (Recommendation 8) The Chief of the Forest Service should adequately describe the processes and related control activities for unliquidated obligations review and certification processes in manuals and handbooks within the Directive System. (Recommendation 9) The Chief of the Forest Service should develop, document, and implement a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that manuals and handbooks for allotments, reimbursable agreements, and review of unliquidated obligations are reviewed and updated every 5 years, consistent with Forest Service policy. (Recommendation 10) The Chief of the Forest Service should develop, document, and implement a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that SOPs and desk guides (1) clearly refer to guidance in the Directive System for allotments, reimbursable agreements, and review of unliquidated obligations and (2) are reviewed and approved by responsible officials prior to use. (Recommendation 11) We provided a draft of this report to USDA for comment. In its comments, reproduced in appendix III, the Forest Service stated that it generally agreed with the report and that it has made significant progress to address the report\u2019s findings. Specifically, the Forest Service stated that its financial policies concerning budget execution have been revised to address our concerns with allotments, unliquidated obligations, commitments, and administrative control of funds as prescribed by OMB Circular No. A-11. Further, the Forest Service stated that it has undertaken an in-depth review of its unliquidated obligations and modified the certification process to comply with the USDA requirement. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) unliquidated obligations. We reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s process documents and control activities, policies and procedures from its manual and handbooks in its Directive System, and other guidance in the form of standard operating procedures (SOP) and desk guides to obtain an understanding of internal controls at the Forest Service related to our three objectives. We reviewed the control activities that the Forest Service identified to determine whether the activities would achieve the control objectives that the service identified and whether the activities were consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also reviewed recent relevant GAO and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Inspector General reports to obtain background information related to the Forest Service\u2019s budget execution processes. We evaluated the design of the Forest Service\u2019s control activities based on data for fiscal year 2016. To address our first objective, we reviewed Forest Service process documents related to allotments and budget authority to obtain an understanding of control activities over the allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any related fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations. The process documents included a list of control objectives and related control activities that the Forest Service had used to assess its internal controls. We also reviewed the related guidance in appendix H to Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget for Administrative Control of Funds, to identify requirements that agencies must meet to ascertain whether their controls over funds management are properly designed. We interviewed key officials from the Forest Service\u2019s Strategic Planning, Budget and Accountability Office to gain an understanding of their processes for allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations for wildland fire suppression activities, including how each of their risk assessments were performed and their plans to mitigate the risks. We reviewed and analyzed the processes documented in the manuals and handbooks collectively referred to as directives to determine whether the processes and control activities were designed to achieve the Forest Service\u2019s stated objectives. Specifically, we examined the Forest Service\u2019s control activities to determine whether these sufficiently communicated the procedures to be performed and the documentation to be prepared. We also reviewed USDA Budget Manual to determine whether Forest Service guidance was consistent with USDA\u2019s requirements for all of its component agencies, specifically requirements related to the administrative control of funds. To address our second objective, we reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials to develop an understanding of its processes related to reimbursable agreements and related collection activities. We first identified, through interviews with Forest Service officials, the different kinds of reimbursable agreements that the Forest Service enters into with other USDA components, other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities to carry out its mission for the benefit of the public. Two distinct types of reimbursable agreements include (1) fire incident cooperative agreements and (2) reimbursable and advanced collection agreements. We reviewed Forest Service process documents and templates related to these two types of reimbursable agreements provided to obtain an understanding of control activities over reimbursable processes. We reviewed the list of control objectives and related control activities that the Forest Service identified to determine whether the control activities were designed to achieve the applicable control objectives. To address our third objective, we reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s policies, procedures, and other documentation related to and interviewed agency officials about unliquidated obligations to develop an understanding of the Forest Service\u2019s review and certification processes for unliquidated obligations balances. We reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s control activities related to its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations to obtain an understanding of control activities around its process and to determine whether the control activities were designed to achieve the applicable control objectives. Based on the results of our evaluation of the Forest Service\u2019s design of internal control activities over the budget execution processes, we did not evaluate the implementation of the control activities or whether they were operating as designed. While our audit objectives focused on certain control activities related to (1) allotments of budgetary resources, the Forest Service\u2019s system for administrative control of funds, and related fund transfers; (2) reimbursables and related collections for reimbursable agreements; and (3) unliquidated obligations, we did not evaluate all control activities and other components of internal control. If we had done so, additional deficiencies may or may not have been identified that could impair the effectiveness of the control activities evaluated as part of this audit. We conducted this performance audit from August 2016 to January 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides the overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal control. Internal control represents an agency\u2019s plans, methods, policies, and procedures used to fulfill its mission, strategic plan, goals, and objectives. Internal control is a process by an entity\u2019s oversight body, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the entity will be achieved. When properly designed, implemented, and operating effectively, it provides reasonable assurance that the following objectives are achieved: (1) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (2) reliability of internal and external reporting, and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is not one event, but a series of actions that occur throughout an entity\u2019s operations. The five components of internal control are as follows: Control Environment - The foundation for an internal control system that provides the discipline and structure to help an entity achieve its objectives. Risk Assessment - Assesses the risks facing the entity as it seeks to achieve its objectives and provides the basis for developing appropriate risk responses. Control Activities - The actions management establishes through policies and procedures to achieve objectives and respond to risks in the internal control system, which includes the entity\u2019s information system. Information and Communication - The quality information management and personnel communicate and use to support the internal control system. Monitoring - Activities management establishes and operates to assess the quality of performance over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. An effective internal control system has each of the five components of internal control effectively designed, implemented, and operating with the components operating together in an integrated manner. In this audit, we assessed the design of control activities at the Forest Service related to its (1) allotments of budgetary resources and any related fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations, (2) reimbursables and related collections, and (3) review of unliquidated obligations. In addition to the contact named above, the following individuals made key contributions to this report: Roger Stoltz (Assistant Director), Meafelia P.

                "The Forest Service, an agency within USDA, performs a variety of tasks as steward of 193 million acres of public forests and grasslands. Its budget execution process for carrying out its mission includes (1) allotments, which are authorizations by an agency to incur obligations within a specified amount, and (2) unliquidated obligations, which represent budgetary resources that have been committed but not yet paid. Deobligation refers to an agency's cancellation or downward adjustments of previously incurred obligations, which may result in funds that may be available for reobligation. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's internal controls over its budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) review and certification of unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report findings."

            "context": "According to the President\u2019s budget, the federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for IT in fiscal year 2018\u2014the largest amount ever budgeted. Despite such large IT expenditures, we have previously reported that investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. For example: The tri-agency National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System was disbanded in February 2010 by the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy after the program spent 16 years and almost $5 billion. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Secure Border Initiative Network program was ended in January 2011, after the department obligated more than $1 billion for the program. The Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program was intended to be delivered by 2014 at a total estimated cost of $609 million, but was terminated in October 2011. The Department of Defense\u2019s Expeditionary Combat Support System was canceled in December 2012 after spending more than a billion dollars and failing to deploy within 5 years of initially obligating funds. The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) decided to terminate its Integrated Health Information System project in 2015. As reported by the agency in August 2017, the Coast Guard spent approximately $60 million over 7 years on this project, which resulted in no equipment or software that could be used for future efforts. Our past work has found that these and other failed IT projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. In many instances, agencies had not consistently applied best practices that are critical to successfully acquiring IT. Such projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance. Executive-level governance and oversight across the government has often been ineffective, specifically from CIOs. For example, we have reported that some CIOs\u2019 roles were limited because they did not have the authority to review and approve the entire agency IT portfolio. In addition to failures when acquiring IT, security deficiencies can threaten systems once they become operational. As we previously reported, in order to counter security threats, 23 civilian Chief Financial Officers Act agencies spent a combined total of approximately $4 billion on IT security-related activities in fiscal year 2016. Even so, our cybersecurity work at federal agencies continues to highlight information security deficiencies. The following examples describe the types of risks we have found at federal agencies. In November 2017, we reported that the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid did not consistently analyze privacy risks for its electronic information systems, and policies and procedures for protecting information systems were not always up to date. In August 2017, we reported that, since the 2015 data breaches, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had taken actions to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data breaches involving sensitive personal and background investigation information. However, we noted that the agency had not fully implemented recommendations made to OPM by DHS\u2019s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team to help the agency improve its overall security posture and improve its ability to protect its systems and information from security breaches. In July 2017, we reported that IT security at the Internal Revenue Service had weaknesses that limited its effectiveness in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer data. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that the Internal Revenue Service had not effectively implemented elements of its information security program. In May 2016, we reported that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and the Department of Veteran Affairs did not always control access to selected high-impact systems, patch known software vulnerabilities, and plan for contingencies. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that the agencies had not fully implemented key elements of their information security programs. In August 2016, we reported that the IT security of the Food and Drug Administration had significant weaknesses that jeopardized the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and industry and public health data. Congress and the President have enacted various key pieces of reform legislation to address IT management issues. These include the federal IT acquisition reform legislation commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). This legislation was intended to improve covered agencies\u2019 acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies\u2019 progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The law includes specific requirements related to seven areas: Agency CIO authority enhancements. CIOs at covered agencies have the authority to, among other things, (1) approve the IT budget requests of their respective agencies and (2) review and approve IT contracts. Federal data center consolidation initiative (FDCCI). Agencies covered by FITARA are required, among other things, to provide a strategy for consolidating and optimizing their data centers and issue quarterly updates on the progress made. Enhanced transparency and improved risk management. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and covered agencies are to make detailed information on federal IT investments publicly available, and agency CIOs are to categorize their investments by level of risk. Portfolio review. Covered agencies are to annually review IT investment portfolios in order to, among other things, increase efficiency and effectiveness and identify potential waste and duplication. Expansion of training and use of IT acquisition cadres. Covered agencies are to update their acquisition human capital plans to support timely and effective IT acquisitions. In doing so, the law calls for agencies to consider, among other things, establishing IT acquisition cadres (i.e., multi-functional groups of professionals to acquire and manage complex programs), or developing agreements with other agencies that have such cadres. Government-wide software purchasing program. The General Services Administration is to develop a strategic sourcing initiative to enhance government-wide acquisition and management of software. In doing so, the law requires that, to the maximum extent practicable, the General Services Administration should allow for the purchase of a software license agreement that is available for use by all executive branch agencies as a single user. Maximizing the benefit of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. Federal agencies are required to compare their purchases of services and supplies to what is offered under the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. In June 2015, OMB released guidance describing how agencies are to implement FITARA. This guidance is intended to, among other things: assist agencies in aligning their IT resources with statutory establish government-wide IT management controls to meet the law\u2019s requirements, while providing agencies with flexibility to adapt to unique agency processes and requirements; strengthen the relationship between agency CIOs and bureau CIOs; strengthen CIO accountability for IT costs, schedules, performance, and security. The guidance identifies a number of actions that agencies are to take to establish a basic set of roles and responsibilities (referred to as the common baseline) for CIOs and other senior agency officials; and thus, to implement the authorities described in the law. For example, agencies are to conduct a self-assessment and submit a plan describing the changes they intend to make to ensure that common baseline responsibilities are implemented. In addition, in August 2016, OMB released guidance intended to, among other things, define a framework for achieving the data center consolidation and optimization requirements of FITARA. The guidance directs agencies to develop a data center consolidation and optimization strategic plan that defines the agency\u2019s data center strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. This strategy is to include, among other things, a statement from the agency CIO indicating whether the agency has complied with all data center reporting requirements in FITARA. Further, the guidance indicates that OMB is to maintain a public dashboard to display consolidation-related costs savings and optimization performance information for the agencies. Congress has recognized the importance of agencies\u2019 continued implementation of FITARA provisions, and has taken legislative action to extend selected provisions beyond their original dates of expiration. Specifically, Congress and the President enacted laws to: remove the expiration date for enhanced transparency and improved risk management provisions, which were set to expire in 2019; remove the expiration date for portfolio review, which was set to expire in 2019; and extend the expiration date for FDCCI from 2018 to 2020. In addition, Congress and the President enacted a law to authorize the availability of funding mechanisms to help further agencies\u2019 efforts to modernize IT. The law, known as the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, authorizes agencies to establish working capital funds for use in transitioning from legacy IT systems, as well as for addressing evolving threats to information security. The law also creates the Technology Modernization Fund, within the Department of the Treasury, from which agencies can \u201cborrow\u201d money to retire and replace legacy systems, as well as acquire or develop systems. Further, in February 2018, OMB issued guidance for agencies to implement the MGT Act. The guidance was intended to provide agencies additional information regarding the Technology Modernization Fund, and the administration and funding of the related IT working capital funds. Specifically, the guidance allowed agencies to begin submitting initial project proposals for modernization on February 27, 2018. In addition, in accordance with the MGT Act, the guidance provides details regarding a Technology Modernization Board, which is to consist of (1) the Federal CIO; (2) a senior official from the General Services Administration; (3) a member of DHS\u2019s National Protection and Program Directorate; and (4) four federal employees with technical expertise in IT development, financial management, cybersecurity and privacy, and acquisition, appointed by the Director of OMB. Congress and the President enacted the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government-wide responsibilities. The act addresses the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks, promotes the use of automated security tools with the ability to continuously monitor and diagnose the security posture of federal agencies, and provides for improved oversight of federal agencies\u2019 information security programs. Specifically, the act clarifies and assigns additional responsibilities to entities such as OMB, DHS, and the federal agencies. Table 1 describes a selection of OMB, DHS, and agency responsibilities. Beyond the implementation of FITARA, FISMA, and related actions, the current administration has also initiated other efforts intended to improve federal IT. Specifically, in March 2017, the administration established the Office of American Innovation, which has a mission to, among other things, make recommendations to the President on policies and plans aimed at improving federal government operations and services. In doing so, the office is to consult with both OMB and the Office of Science and Technology Policy on policies and plans intended to improve government operations and services, improve the quality of life for Americans, and spur job creation. In May 2017, the Administration also established the American Technology Council, which has a goal of helping to transform and modernize federal agency IT and how the federal government uses and delivers digital services. The President is the chairman of this council, and the Federal CIO and the United States Digital Service Administrator are among the members. In addition, on May 11, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This executive order outlined actions to enhance cybersecurity across federal agencies and critical infrastructure to improve the nation\u2019s cyber posture and capabilities against cyber security threats. Among other things, the order tasked the Director of the American Technology Council to coordinate a report to the President from the Secretary of DHS, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, regarding the modernization of federal IT. As a result, the Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization was issued on December 13, 2017, and outlined the current and envisioned state of federal IT. The report focused on modernization efforts to improve the security posture of federal IT and recognized that agencies have attempted to modernize systems but have been stymied by a variety of factors, including resource prioritization, ability to procure services quickly, and technical issues. The report provided multiple recommendations intended to address these issues through the modernization and consolidation of networks and the use of shared services to enable future network architectures. Further, in March 2018, the Administration issued the President\u2019s Management Agenda, which lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government. The agenda identifies three related drivers of transformation\u2014IT modernization; data, accountability, and transparency; and the workforce of the future\u2014that are intended to push change across the federal government. The Administration also established 14 related Cross-Agency Priority goals, many of which have elements that involve IT. In particular, the Cross-Agency Priority goal on IT modernization states that modern IT must function as the backbone of how government serves the public in the digital age and provides three priorities that are to guide the Administration\u2019s efforts to modernize federal IT: (1) enhancing mission effectiveness by improving the quality and efficiency of critical services, including the increased utilization of cloud-based solutions; (2) reducing cybersecurity risks to the federal mission by leveraging current commercial capabilities and implementing cutting edge cybersecurity capabilities; and (3) building a modern IT workforce by recruiting, reskilling, and retaining professionals able to help drive modernization with up-to-date technology. Most recently, on May 15, 2018, the President signed Executive Order 13833, Enhancing the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information Officers. Among other things, this executive order is intended to better position agencies to modernize their IT systems, execute IT programs more efficiently, and reduce cybersecurity risks. The order pertains to 22 of the 24 Chief Financial Officer Act agencies: the Department of Defense and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are exempt. For the covered agencies, the executive order strengthens the role of agency CIOs by, among other things, requiring to report directly to their agency head; to serve as their agency head\u2019s primary IT strategic advisor; and to have a significant role in all management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT. In addition, one of the cybersecurity requirements directs agencies to ensure that the CIO works closely with an integrated team of senior executives, including those with expertise in IT, security, and privacy, to implement appropriate risk management measures. In the February 2017 update to our high-risk series, we reported that agencies still needed to complete significant work related to the management of IT acquisitions and operations We stressed that OMB and federal agencies should continue to expeditiously implement FITARA and OMB\u2019s related guidance, which include enhancing CIO authority, consolidating data centers, and acquiring and managing software licenses. Our update to this high-risk area also stressed that OMB and agencies needed to continue to implement our prior recommendations in order to improve their ability to effectively and efficiently invest in IT. Specifically, from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, we made 803 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. In addition, in fiscal year 2016, we made 202 new recommendations, thus, further reinforcing the need for OMB and agencies to address the shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. As stated in the update, OMB and agencies should demonstrate government-wide progress in the management of IT investments by, among other things, implementing at least 80 percent of our recommendations related to managing IT acquisitions and operations within 4 years. As of May 2018, OMB and agencies had fully implemented 489 (or about 61 percent) of the 803 recommendations. Figure 1 summarizes the progress that OMB and agencies have made in addressing our recommendations as compared to the 80 percent target. Overall, federal agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in cost savings and additional management improvements if they address these recommendations, including those aimed at implementing CIO responsibilities, review of IT acquisitions; improving data center consolidation; and managing software licenses. In all, the various laws, such as FITARA, and related guidance assign 35 IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. These areas are: leadership and accountability, budgeting, information security, investment management, workforce, and strategic planning. In a draft report on CIO responsibilities that we have provided to the agencies for comment and plan to issue in June 2018, our preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 agencies we reviewed had policies that fully addressed the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. In this regard, a majority of the agencies fully or substantially addressed the role of their CIOs for the area of leadership and accountability. In addition, a majority of the agencies substantially or partially addressed the role of their CIOs for two areas: information security and IT budgeting. However, most agencies partially or minimally addressed the role of their CIOs for two areas: investment management and strategic planning. These preliminary results are shown in figure 2. Despite these shortfalls, most agency officials stated that their CIOs are implementing the responsibilities even if the agencies do not have policies requiring implementation. Nevertheless, the CIOs of the 24 selected agencies acknowledged in responses to a survey that we administered for our draft report that they were not always very effective in implementing the six IT management areas. Specifically, our preliminary results show that at least 10 of the CIOs indicated that they were less than very effective for each of the six areas of responsibility. We believe that until agencies fully address the role of CIOs in their policies, agencies will be limited in addressing longstanding IT management challenges. Figure 3 depicts that extent to which the CIOs reported their effectiveness in implementing the six areas of responsibility. Beyond the actions of the agencies, however, our preliminary results indicate that shortcomings in agencies\u2019 policies also are partially attributable to two weaknesses in OMB\u2019s FITARA implementation guidance. First, the guidance does not comprehensively address all CIO responsibilities, such as those related to assessing the extent to which personnel meet IT management knowledge and skill requirements, and ensuring that personnel are held accountable for complying with the information security program. Correspondingly, the majority of the agencies\u2019 policies did not fully address nearly all of the responsibilities that were not included in OMB\u2019s guidance. Second, OMB\u2019s guidance does not ensure that CIOs have a significant role in (1) IT planning, programming, and budgeting decisions and (2) execution decisions and the management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT, as required by federal law and guidance. In the absence of comprehensive guidance, CIOs will not be positioned to effectively acquire, maintain, and secure their IT systems. Based on our preliminary results, 24 agency CIOs also identified a number of factors that enabled and challenged their ability to effectively manage IT. As shown in figure 4, five factors were identified by at least half of the 24 CIOs as major enablers and three factors were identified by at least half of the CIOs as major challenges. Specifically, most agency CIOs cited five factors as being enablers to effectively carry out their responsibilities: (1) NIST guidance, (2) the CIO\u2019s position in the agency hierarchy, (3) OMB guidance, (4) coordination with the Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), and (5) legal authority. Further, three factors were cited by CIOs as major factors that have challenged their ability to effectively carry out responsibilities: (1) processes for hiring, recruiting, and retaining IT personnel; (2) financial resources; and (3) the availability of personnel/staff resources. As our draft report states, although OMB has issued guidance aimed at addressing the three factors that were identified by at least half of the CIOs as major challenges, the guidance does not fully address those challenges. Further, regarding the financial resources challenge, OMB recently required agencies to provide data on CIO authority over IT spending; however, its guidance does not provide a complete definition of the authority. We believe that in the absence of such guidance, agencies have created varying definitions of CIO authority. Further, until OMB updates its guidance to include a complete definition of the authority that CIOs are to have over IT spending, it will be difficult for OMB to identify any deficiencies in this area and to help agencies make any needed improvements. In order to address challenges in implementing CIO responsibilities, we intend to include in our draft report recommendations to OMB and each of the selected 24 federal agencies to improve the effectiveness of CIOs\u2019 implementation of their responsibilities for each of the six IT management areas. FITARA includes a provision to enhance covered agency CIOs\u2019 authority through, among other things, requiring agency heads to ensure that CIOs review and approve IT contracts. OMB\u2019s FITARA implementation guidance expanded upon this aspect of the legislation in a number of ways. Specifically, according to the guidance: CIOs may review and approve IT acquisition strategies and plans, rather than individual IT contracts; CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives, but the CIOs must retain accountability; CAOs are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and CAOs are to indicate to the CIOs when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT. In January 2018, we reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. For instance, most of the 22 agencies did not identify all of their IT contracts. In this regard, the agencies identified 78,249 IT- related contracts, to which they obligated $14.7 billion in fiscal year 2016. However, we identified 31,493 additional contracts with $4.5 billion obligated, raising the total amount obligated by these agencies to IT contracts in fiscal year 2016 to at least $19.2 billion. Figure 5 reflects the obligations that the 22 selected agencies reported to us relative to the obligations we identified. The percentage of additional IT contract obligations we identified varied among the selected agencies. For example, the Department of State did not identify 1 percent of its IT contract obligations. Conversely, 8 agencies did not identify over 40 percent of their IT contract obligations. Many of the selected agencies that did not identify these IT contract obligations did not follow OMB guidance. Specifically, 14 of the 22 agencies did not involve the acquisition office in their process to identify IT acquisitions for CIO review, as required by OMB. In addition, 7 agencies did not establish guidance to aid officials in recognizing IT. We concluded that until these agencies involve the acquisitions office in their IT acquisition identification processes and establish supporting guidance, they cannot ensure that they will identify all IT acquisitions. Without proper identification of IT acquisitions, these agencies and CIOs cannot effectively provide oversight of these acquisitions. In addition to not identifying all IT contracts, 14 of the 22 selected agencies did not fully satisfy OMB\u2019s requirement that the CIO review and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that we evaluated were CIO-reviewed and approved as required by OMB\u2019s guidance. The 85 IT contracts not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8 billion. We believe that until agencies ensure that CIOs are able to review and approve all IT acquisitions, CIOs will continue to have limited visibility and input into their agencies\u2019 planned IT expenditures and will not be able to use the increased authority that FITARA\u2019s contract approval provision is intended to provide. Further, agencies will likely miss an opportunity to strengthen CIOs\u2019 authority and the oversight of IT acquisitions. As a result, agencies may award IT contracts that are duplicative, wasteful, or poorly conceived. As a result of these findings, we made 39 recommendations in our January 2018 report. The recommendations included that agencies ensure that their acquisition offices are involved in identifying IT acquisitions and issuing related guidance, and that IT acquisitions are reviewed in accordance with OMB guidance. OMB and the majority of the agencies generally agreed with or did not comment on the recommendations. In our February 2017 high-risk update, we stated that OMB and agencies needed to demonstrate additional progress on achieving data center consolidation savings in order to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations. Further, data center consolidation efforts are key to implementing FITARA. Specifically, OMB established the FDCCI in February 2010 to improve the efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of federal data center activities. The enactment of FITARA in 2014 codified and expanded the initiative. In a series of reports that we issued from July 2011 through August 2017, we noted that, while data center consolidation could potentially save the federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses existed in several areas, including agencies\u2019 data center consolidation plans, data center optimization, and OMB\u2019s tracking and reporting on related cost savings. In these reports, we made a total of 160 recommendations to OMB and 24 agencies to improve the execution and oversight of the initiative. Most agencies and OMB agreed with our recommendations or had no comments. As of May 2018, 80 of these 160 recommendations remained unimplemented. Further, we recently reported in May 2018 that the 24 agencies participating in OMB\u2019s Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) had communicated mixed progress toward achieving OMB\u2019s goals for closing data centers by September 2018. Over half of the agencies reported that they had either already met, or planned to meet, all of their OMB- assigned goals by the deadline. This would result in the closure of 7,221 of the 12,062 centers that agencies reported in August 2017. However, 4 agencies reported that they do not have plans to meet all of their assigned goals and 2 agencies are working with OMB to establish revised targets. With regard to agencies\u2019 progress in achieving cost savings, 24 agencies reported $3.9 billion in cost savings through 2018. The 24 agencies also reported limited progress against OMB\u2019s five data center optimization targets for server utilization and automated monitoring, energy metering, power usage effectiveness, facility utilization, and virtualization. As of August 2017, 1 agency reported that it had met four targets, 1 agency reported that it had met three targets, 6 agencies reported having met either one or two targets, and 14 agencies reported meeting none of the targets. Further, as of August 2017, most agencies were not planning to meet OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018 optimization targets. Specifically, 4 agencies reported plans to meet all of their applicable targets by the end of fiscal year 2018; 14 agencies reported plans to meet some of the targets; and 4 reported that they did not plan to meet any targets. Figure 6 summarizes agency-reported plans to meet or exceed the OMB\u2019s data center optimization targets, as of August 2017. In 2016 and 2017, we made 81 recommendations to OMB and the 24 DCOI agencies to help improve the reporting of data center-related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets. As of May 2018, 71 of these 81 recommendations have not been fully addressed. In our 2015 high-risk report\u2019s discussion of IT acquisitions and operations, we identified the management of software licenses as an area of concern, in part because of the potential for cost savings. Federal agencies engage in thousands of software licensing agreements annually. The objective of software license management is to manage, control, and protect an organization\u2019s software assets. Effective management of these licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses, which can result in unused software, as well as too few licenses, which can result in noncompliance with license terms and cause the imposition of additional fees. As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed policy that addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software licenses. In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve significant savings government-wide. Of the 24 selected agencies we reviewed, only 2 had comprehensive policies that included the establishment of clear roles and central oversight authority for managing enterprise software license agreements, among other things. Of the remaining 22 agencies, 18 had policies that were not comprehensive, and 4 had not developed any policies. Further, we found that only 2 of the 24 selected agencies had established comprehensive software license inventories, a leading practice that would help them to adequately manage their software licenses. The inadequate implementation of this and other leading practices in software license management was partially due to weaknesses in agencies\u2019 policies. As a result, we concluded that agencies\u2019 oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking, thus potentially leading to missed savings. However, the potential savings could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal agency reported saving approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise license agreements, even when its oversight process was ad hoc. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue a directive to help guide agencies in managing software licenses. We also made 135 recommendations to the 24 agencies to improve their policies and practices for managing licenses. Among other things, we recommended that the agencies regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment decision making. Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no comments. As of May 2018, 78 of the 135 recommendations had not been implemented. Table 2 reflects the extent to which the 24 agencies implemented the recommendations in these two areas. Since information security was added to the high-risk list in 1997, we have consistently identified shortcomings in the federal government\u2019s approach to cybersecurity. We have previously testified that, even though agencies have acted to improve the protections over federal and critical infrastructure information and information systems, the federal government needs to take the following actions to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity: Effectively implement risk-based entity-wide information security programs consistently over time. Among other things, agencies need to (1) implement sustainable processes for securely configuring operating systems, applications, workstations, servers, and network devices; (2) patch vulnerable systems and replace unsupported software; (3) develop comprehensive security test and evaluation procedures and conduct examinations on a regular and recurring basis; and (4) strengthen oversight of contractors providing IT services. Improve its cyber incident detection, response, and mitigation capabilities. DHS needs to expand the capabilities and support wider adoption of its government-wide intrusion detection and prevention system. In addition, the federal government needs to improve cyber incident response practices, update guidance on reporting data breaches, and develop consistent responses to breaches of personally identifiable information. Expand its cyber workforce planning and training efforts. The federal government needs to (1) enhance efforts for recruiting and retaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce and (2) improve cybersecurity workforce planning activities. Expand efforts to strengthen cybersecurity of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. The federal government needs to develop metrics to (1) assess the effectiveness of efforts promoting the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and (2) measure and report on the effectiveness of cyber risk mitigation activities and the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure sectors. Better oversee protection of personally identifiable information. The federal government needs to (1) protect the security and privacy of electronic health information, (2) ensure privacy when face recognition systems are used, and (3) protect the privacy of users\u2019 data on state-based health insurance marketplaces. As we have previously noted, in order to take the preceding actions and strengthen the federal government\u2019s cybersecurity posture, agencies should implement the information security programs required by FISMA. In this regard, FISMA provides a framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls for federal information resources. The law requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency- wide information security program. Such a program includes risk assessments; the development and implementation of policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce risks; plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities, and systems; security awareness and specialized training; the testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of controls; the planning, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of remedial actions to address information security deficiencies; procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; and plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations. Since 2010, we have made 2,733 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations have identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen technical security controls over their computer networks and systems. They also have included recommendations for agencies to fully implement aspects of their information security programs, as mandated by FISMA. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because many of these recommendations have not been implemented. As of May 2018, 793 of information security-related recommendations we have made have not been implemented. In order to determine the effectiveness of the agencies\u2019 information security programs and practices, FISMA requires that federal agencies\u2019 inspectors general conduct annual independent evaluations. The agencies are to report the results of these evaluations to OMB, and OMB is to summarize the results in annual reports to Congress. In these evaluations, the inspectors general frame the scope of their analysis, identify key findings, and detail recommendations to address the findings. The evaluations also are to capture maturity model ratings for their respective agencies. Toward this end, in fiscal year 2017, the inspector general community, in partnership with OMB and DHS, finalized a 3-year effort to create a maturity model for FISMA metrics that align to the five function areas in the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework): identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. This alignment is intended to help promote consistent and comparable metrics and criteria and provides agencies with a meaningful independent assessment of their information security programs. This maturity model is designed to summarize the status of agencies\u2019 information security programs on a five-level capability maturity scale. The five maturity levels are defined as follows: Level 1 Ad-hoc: Policies, procedures, and strategy are not formalized; activities are performed in an ad-hoc, reactive manner. Level 2 Defined: Policies, procedures, and strategy are formalized and documented but not consistently implemented. Level 3 Consistently Implemented: Policies, procedures, and strategy are consistently implemented, but quantitative and qualitative effectiveness measures are lacking. Level 4 Managed and Measurable: Quantitative and qualitative measures on the effectiveness of policies, procedures, and strategy are collected across the organizations and used to assess them and make necessary changes. Level 5 Optimized: Policies, procedures, and strategy are fully institutionalized, repeatable, self-generating, consistently implemented and regularly updated based on a changing threat and technology landscape and business/mission needs. In March 2018, OMB issued its annual FISMA report to Congress, which showed the combined results of the inspectors general\u2019s fiscal year 2017 evaluations. Based on data from 76 agency inspector general and independent auditor assessments, OMB determined that the government-wide median maturity model ratings across the five NIST Cybersecurity Framework areas did not exceed a level 3 (consistently implemented). Table 3 shows the inspectors general\u2019s median ratings for each of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework areas. In its efforts toward strengthening the federal government\u2019s cybersecurity, OMB also requires agencies to submit related cybersecurity metrics as part of its Cross-Agency Priority goals. In particular, OMB developed the IT modernization goal so that federal agencies will be able to build and maintain more modern, secure, and resilient IT. A key part of this goal is to reduce cybersecurity risks to the federal mission through three strategies: manage asset security, protect networks and data, and limit personnel access. The key targets supporting each of these strategies correspond to areas within the FISMA metrics. Table 4 outlines the strategies and their associated targets. In conclusion, FITARA and FISMA present opportunities for the federal government to address the high-risk areas on improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, and ensuring the security of federal IT, thereby saving billions of dollars. Most agencies have taken steps to execute key IT management and cybersecurity initiatives, including implementing CIO responsibilities, requiring CIO review of IT acquisitions, realizing data center consolidation cost savings, managing software assets, and complying with FISMA requirements. The agencies have also continued to address the recommendations that we have made over the past several years. However, further efforts by OMB and federal agencies to implement our previous recommendations would better position them to improve the management and security of federal IT. To help ensure that these efforts succeed, we will continue to monitor agencies\u2019 efforts toward implementing these recommendations.

                "The federal government plans to invest almost $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018. Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls. Most agencies agreed with these recommendations, and GAO will continue to monitor their implementation."

            "context": "U.S. agencies perform a wide variety of activities that contribute to export promotion, and responsibility for these activities is widely dispersed. Some of the services these agencies provide are intended, at least in part, to assist U.S. companies in entering foreign markets or expanding their presence abroad. For example, the U.S. government distributes trade-related information to exporters, conducts foreign country market research, and provides counseling to U.S. companies throughout the export process. U.S. agencies may also use diplomatic tools to advocate on behalf of U.S. companies to help ensure they can compete on a level playing field in export markets. Three of these agencies\u2014State, Commerce, and USDA\u2014receive appropriations that are restricted from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products. These agencies promote the growth of other U.S. exports through various activities, as discussed in table 1. Congress has restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated for State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products since the 1990s. In 1990, we reported that U.S. policy and programs for assisting the export of tobacco and tobacco products worked at cross purposes to U.S. health policy and initiatives, both domestically and internationally. Congress later restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated to State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products. During fiscal years 1994 through 2003, Congress prohibited funds generally appropriated for USDA through annual appropriations acts from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. In fiscal year 2004, Congress permanently prohibited funds appropriated for USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. According to USDA officials, USDA stopped its efforts to gather and disseminate tobacco-related production and consumption information overseas in the early 2000s. Congress restricted the use of certain appropriated funds, including appropriations for Commerce and State, from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products from fiscal years 1998 through 2017. Congress passed the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, which prohibited the funds provided by the act from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. This act also prohibited the funds provided by the act from being used to seek the reduction or removal of foreign country restrictions on the marketing of tobacco or tobacco products. The act provided an exception for the funds to be used to address foreign-country restrictions on tobacco marketing that are not applied equally to all tobacco or tobacco products of the same type. These restrictions have been enacted through annual appropriations acts through fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, Congress altered the restriction language on tobacco promotion in the act making appropriations for State, which, according to State, makes promotion activities permissive with respect to the use of State appropriations. Congress used the term \u201cshould\u201d in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2018 (2018 State Appropriations Act) instead of the term \u201cshall\u201d as in prior acts making appropriations for State. Specifically, the 2018 State Appropriations Act states that \u201cNone of the funds made available by this Act should be available to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. . . .\u201d In contrast, prior acts making appropriations for State stated \u201cNone of the funds made available by this Act shall be available to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. . . .\u201d According to State officials, they interpreted the term \u201cshall\u201d in prior appropriations acts as a mandatory action, whereas the use of the term \u201cshould\u201d gives the agency more discretion in how it addresses the restrictions. However, State has not changed how it addresses the restrictions and does not plan to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco, according to State officials. The legislation restricting fiscal year 2018 appropriations provided to Commerce and USDA from being used to promote tobacco retains the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d language. According to Commerce and USDA officials, the change to State\u2019s restriction language does not affect the agencies\u2019 activities because Commerce and USDA are still subject to the mandatory restrictions outlined in their agencies\u2019 appropriations language. State collaborates with Commerce, USDA, and other agencies to develop and periodically issue an interagency guidance cable to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to officials, this cable serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions on promoting tobacco for their officials at all posts overseas. State collaborates with Commerce, USDA, and other agencies to develop and periodically issue an interagency guidance cable to all posts overseas to facilitate their implementation of funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. State officials draft the updated cable and Commerce, USDA, and other agency officials have the opportunity to review and comment on it before State issues it through its cable system. This cable serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions, according to officials at these agencies (see table 2). State has updated and issued the interagency guidance cable four times since 2013 to address changes in tobacco technology and other emerging issues, according to State officials. We identified two significant changes to the cable over the past 5 years. Addition of information concerning attendance at corporate social responsibility events: In May 2013, State added a provision that post officials should consult with headquarters before attending corporate social responsibility events involving U.S. tobacco companies. State officials in headquarters acknowledged that post officials may not link some activities, such as participating in corporate social responsibility events, to the promotion of or selling of products. They noted that this is why it is important to make post officials aware of the actions they should or should not take through the interagency guidance cable. Changes to the scope of tobacco products: In recent updates to the cable, State expanded the description of \u201ctobacco and tobacco products\u201d to address the emergence of new delivery systems for tobacco. Specifically, in 2014 State added the language \u201ctobacco delivering products, such as electronic cigarettes\u201d to provide an example of a tobacco product. In 2016, State changed the description to \u201celectronic nicotine delivery systems such as e-cigarettes.\u201d Then in 2018, State added \u201cnon-combustible products such as smokeless tobacco\u201d to the description of tobacco products. In response to the revised funding restriction language in the 2018 State Appropriations Act, State modified the 2018 cable stating that the changes make promotion activities permissive with respect to the use of State appropriations. However, State decided not to change the portion of the cable describing specific actions officials should or should not take in the version it issued in April 2018, because according to State officials, they do not plan to promote tobacco. In addition, Commerce and USDA officials said that the change to State\u2019s restriction language has not changed how they interpret the guidance. Commerce relies on both the interagency guidance cable as well as its client eligibility policy to implement restrictions on promoting tobacco. Commerce\u2019s client eligibility policy applies to all export promotion services that Commerce provides and educates officials on how to effectively manage U.S. company requests for commercial assistance. The policy\u2019s section on exceptions and other bases for declining services to companies states that Commerce is prohibited by law from promoting the export of tobacco or tobacco-related products. Commerce issued its updated client eligibility policy in October 2018. USDA relies on the interagency guidance cable to provide direction to its officials overseas, and does not have agency-specific guidance for implementing its permanent funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. USDA officials said that the cable sufficiently addresses the funding restrictions on the agency\u2019s promotion activities and helps to ensure that all officials serving at posts overseas conduct activities in a consistent manner. Most State, Commerce, and USDA officials overseas we interviewed were aware of the restrictions on promoting tobacco. Most officials we interviewed had received some guidance concerning the restrictions, but several officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. Moreover, two of the agencies\u2019 current training courses do not address the restrictions. Officials in 21 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed were aware of the restrictions. The three offices that were not aware of the restrictions were from State. Although these officials were not aware of the restrictions, they said they had never provided services to U.S. tobacco companies. Commerce and USDA headquarters officials said that it is widely known within their agencies that staff should not promote tobacco. Commerce and USDA officials said the guidance concerning these restrictions has been consistent for many years and that staff in the field and in headquarters are very aware of the restrictions. Most officials overseas had received some guidance concerning the restrictions on promoting tobacco. Officials in 21 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed had received written or verbal guidance concerning the restrictions on promoting tobacco at some point in their career. For example, officials in 15 offices mentioned receiving the State-issued interagency guidance cable when we asked them what type of tobacco-related guidance they had received. In addition, officials in four of the eight Commerce offices recalled receiving agency-specific guidance. Some officials said that their supervisors had informed them they are not allowed to promote tobacco exports. Some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable, which agency officials said serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions, and some were not aware that State periodically issues the cable. For example, one USDA official stated that he could not recall the last time he received guidance and noted that cables can easily be overlooked. He recommended that USDA improve its efforts to distribute the cable and have supervisors maintain an annual checklist to ensure staff have read and understand it or incorporate it into annual training. A State official told us that he was in Washington, D.C. when State issued the prior cable and he did not learn about it until he had been stationed at his next overseas post for several months. A Commerce official noted that some officials new to post may not receive the interagency guidance cable for several months. All officials working overseas can access the interagency guidance cable through the State cable database or access other resources if a tobacco- related issue arises. For example, the Commerce client eligibility policy and the interagency guidance cable are available on an internal Commerce website. USDA officials in headquarters stated that they do not remind officials overseas about the restrictions or available guidance, but that, in response to our audit work, they plan to send an annual reminder. Finally, many post officials we interviewed said that they are aware of the activities their colleagues are undertaking and would have the opportunity to educate their colleagues before they provided any services to a tobacco company. Officials in 15 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed said they did not receive any training concerning restrictions on promoting tobacco. In the past, State, Commerce, and USDA did not include information about the funding restrictions or related guidance in training materials. State and USDA officials in headquarters confirmed that training materials for officials conducting export promotion activities overseas do not address funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to an official at State\u2019s Foreign Service Institute, tobacco products may be discussed in a trade-related course when describing those products officials should not advocate for, or in the 6-month economic studies course when examining the nexus between trade issues and public policy. However, State could not provide documentation of where this is specifically addressed in its curriculum. A USDA official stated that none of the Foreign Agricultural Service training courses explicitly discuss restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to Commerce officials, the training for new trade specialists did not include information about the restrictions on promoting tobacco when Commerce last provided the training in 2014. However, in response to our audit work, Commerce added this information into its training materials for new trade specialists in September 2018. Officials who do not receive training on the restrictions early in their careers may not be aware that they are prohibited from promoting tobacco. For example, one Commerce official told us he did not know about the restrictions while serving at his first post when he attended a meeting that involved representatives from the tobacco industry. He noted that he now questions whether he would have attended the meeting if he had known about the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training, aimed at developing employee knowledge, skills, and abilities, is essential to an organization\u2019s operational success. If agencies do not explicitly include information about the restrictions and related guidance in training materials for officials conducting export promotion activities overseas, officials may work at a post for several months, or longer, before learning about the restrictions. The State, Commerce, and USDA officials we interviewed said they have implemented the funding restrictions on tobacco as outlined in the interagency guidance cable issued by State. For example, post officials said they have not promoted the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products or attended events solely sponsored by tobacco companies, though many officials said they attended events at which officials from tobacco companies were present. Post officials identified three areas of the guidance that may benefit from additional clarification, according to interviews with agency officials and our review of agency emails. Our interviews with State, Commerce, and USDA officials in 24 offices in nine countries and our review of agency documents, showed that posts have implemented the interagency guidance outlining actions they should not take (see table 3.) Post officials identified three areas of the guidance that may benefit from additional clarification, according to our interviews with agency officials and our review of agency emails: attendance at events, the types of permitted services, and the description of tobacco products. Officials from all three agencies raised questions about whether and when it is permissible to attend events at which tobacco company representatives are present. The guidance does not specifically address attendance at events also attended by representatives of tobacco companies. State headquarters officials said the vast majority of questions received from posts concern whether personnel at a post may participate in an event when representatives from a company engaged in the tobacco industry are also expected to participate in that event. We also reviewed emails in which Commerce officials asked for additional guidance about attending events or meetings with tobacco companies. For example, one post official asked whether the embassy could invite a tobacco company to participate in an embassy-organized trade mission that would include meetings with the local governor and mayor. In this case, Commerce headquarters officials advised that the tobacco company\u2019s participation could be construed as U.S. government support for the company\u2019s commercial activities and recommended against including the tobacco company. A USDA official in headquarters also noted that attending events could, in some cases, be construed as supporting tobacco companies, and noted that this is an area where staff could use more guidance. Representatives from several tobacco control organizations expressed concern that interactions between U.S. government officials and representatives from tobacco companies at events organized by business associations created a perception that the U.S. government supported tobacco company sales in the country. For example, in 2017 a business association hosted a trade mission to one Southeast Asian country that included representatives from 30 U.S. companies, including a U.S. tobacco company. In response, two tobacco control organizations wrote to the U.S. ambassador in that country voicing their concern that U.S. government officials\u2019 attendance at meetings that included the tobacco company representatives violated the spirit of the interagency guidance cable and gave the appearance that the U.S. government supports the tobacco company. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief of Mission distributed guidance specific to that post stating that officials were not allowed to attend a trade mission\u2019s events or meetings if representatives from a tobacco company were scheduled to give a presentation. Several post officials said that attending events organized by business associations is a key function of their job. They attend these events to, among other things, exchange information about the local business climate and learn about the concerns of American companies. Commerce and USDA officials identified ambiguities in the guidance concerning the types of services they are allowed to provide to tobacco companies or the tobacco industry. In 14 of the 21 Commerce emails we reviewed, officials at posts asked for additional guidance about the types of services they are permitted to provide to tobacco companies or the types of companies or products they can support. For example, some post officials asked whether they could engage with the host country government to obtain information about pending tobacco-related legislation at the request of a tobacco company. In one case, Commerce headquarters advised post officials that the restrictions did not prohibit them from raising concerns on a legislative proposal that would discriminate against foreign tobacco companies. They further noted that because of the sensitive nature of tobacco-related issues, any policy decision to engage should be weighed carefully. Commerce\u2019s client eligibility policy does not provide a description of the types of actions Commerce officials should and should not take with regards to tobacco companies and products. The interagency guidance cable also does not provide information about some types of services, such as whether officials should engage with host country government officials to learn about pending tobacco-related legislation. According to a USDA official, some officials overseas interpret \u201cpromotional\u201d activities differently and did not agree on whether both marketing and trade-related activities, such as enforcing trade agreements, are promotional activities. Commerce officials at post asked for additional guidance about whether they could provide export promotion services to companies exporting certain tobacco-related products in 3 of the 21 emails we reviewed. For example, some Commerce officials asked whether they could provide services to companies selling component parts for electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-liquids. Commerce\u2019s prior client eligibility policy, issued in May 2017, did not include a list of tobacco products covered by the policy; whereas, the interagency guidance cable issued in 2014 states that tobacco products include tobacco delivery systems, such as electronic cigarettes, and the updated version issued in 2018 added non-combustible products, such as smokeless tobacco, to this description. However, neither the interagency guidance cable nor Commerce\u2019s updated client eligibility policy specifically states whether the description includes component parts for electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products. GAO previously reported that electronic cigarettes include a wide range of products that share the same basic design and generally consist of three main parts: a power source, a heating element, and a cartridge or tank containing liquid solution, which is often sold separately. According to State officials in headquarters, the guidance on promoting tobacco was written for a broad audience and to make post officials mindful of the restrictions. They said they trust that officials overseas will use their professional judgment and in-country expertise to determine if post\u2019s support for an event or a company will be construed as promotion of a tobacco product. Moreover, State and Commerce officials said that they expect officials overseas to ask headquarters questions to clarify the interagency guidance cable. While federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk, we found that the interagency guidance does not provide examples of the factors post officials should consider when attending business association events. The guidance also lacks sufficient examples of the types of services officials are allowed to provide to tobacco companies and a clear description of tobacco products. More specific guidance would help ensure that State, Commerce, and USDA officials consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. The United States exported over $2 billion in tobacco and tobacco-related products in 2017. Congress has enacted restrictions on the use of certain appropriated funds to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products since the 1990s, and State, Commerce, and USDA have developed and updated guidance to implement these restrictions. However, not all officials were aware of the restrictions and more than half had not received training about the restrictions. Including information about the restrictions in training materials would help make officials aware of the restrictions early in their careers and prompt them to seek guidance if a tobacco-related issue arises. If officials conducting export promotion activities are unaware of the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco sales and exports, they may also be unaware of the activities they should and should not undertake. Moreover, some officials said that the guidance is unclear in some areas. Although officials said they need to attend business association events to support all U.S. companies conducting business in a country, they were unsure whether they can attend events where representatives from U.S. tobacco companies may be present. In addition, some officials also indicated that the current guidance lacks clarity on the types of services officials are allowed to provide to tobacco interests and what constitutes a tobacco product. Although we did not identify any instances in which a State, Commerce, or USDA official directly promoted U.S. tobacco products, clearer guidance would help to ensure that officials will consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions. We are making three recommendations, including two to State and one to USDA. Specifically: The Secretary of State should work with the Foreign Service Institute to include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in its training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Agriculture should include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Agriculture, should assess the interagency guidance cable on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas and update it to address ambiguities, as needed. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to State, Commerce, USDA, and USTR for review and comment. In their comments, reproduced in appendix III, State concurred with our recommendations and described planned actions to address them. USDA concurred with the recommendation and told us that they had no comments on the draft report. Commerce and USTR told us that they had no comments on the draft report. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Department of State, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Trade Representative, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. This report examines (1) the guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas, (2) to what extent overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) to what extent select U.S. agencies have implemented this guidance overseas. To address our first objective, we reviewed U.S. appropriations laws that prohibited the funds appropriated therein from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. We also reviewed guidance issued by the Departments of State (State) and Commerce (Commerce) concerning the promotion of tobacco exports overseas. We also interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) about the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas and the development and revision of guidance on tobacco promotion. To address our second objective, we interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA about any training officials posted overseas receive concerning the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. In addition, we held structured interviews with 35 State, Commerce, and USDA officials overseas conducting export promotion activities and reached out to an additional 10 officials to ask about activities associated with the solicitation of gifts and attendance at corporate social responsibility events. These officials were located across 11 posts and in 9 countries. We interviewed officials in Cambodia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Because multiple officials from one agency attended a meeting in some cases, we are reporting their combined responses as one \u201coffice\u201d response. Thus, we are reporting the results from the 24 offices we interviewed\u20149 State, 8 Commerce, and 7 USDA offices. We selected this non-generalizable sample of countries based on criteria that included the countries\u2019 large or increasing amounts of U.S. tobacco imports, relatively high tobacco smoking prevalence rates, and geographic dispersion. The information obtained from these interviews is neither generalizable nor reflects the experiences of all State, Commerce, and USDA officials serving at posts overseas, but it does provide insights into officials\u2019 experiences at post and illustrative examples across our sample on the topics discussed. To address our third objective, we interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA about post officials\u2019 implementation of guidance regarding the promotion of tobacco exports, the types of questions they receive from post officials about the funding restrictions and guidance, and the additional advice they provide to post officials overseas. We asked post officials about the clarity of guidance, whether they attended events sponsored or attended by representatives of U.S. tobacco companies, and whether they discussed tobacco-related issues with host country government officials during our structured interviews with the 24 State, Commerce, and USDA offices overseas. We also analyzed a Commerce database, agency emails, and State cables and conducted a literature search. Commerce documents all the fee-based services it provides to companies in a database. We obtained a list of approximately 30,000 fee-based services Commerce provided in fiscal years 2013 through 2017, which included the name of the companies to which Commerce provided these services. We then downloaded a list of 763 U.S. tobacco companies from Nexus using criteria such as industry classification codes related to tobacco and tobacco products and the location of company headquarters. We limited the list of U.S. tobacco companies to those with revenues greater than $5 million. We then compared the two lists to determine if Commerce provided any fee-based services to U.S. tobacco companies. To assess the reliability of the Commerce fee-based services data, we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed knowledgeable officials about system controls. We determined that Commerce\u2019s fee-based services data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. In addition, we requested State, Commerce, and USDA email communications concerning tobacco-related issues sent between January 2015 and February 2018 from post officials to headquarters. State was only able to provide one such email. USDA provided several emails, but the emails were not from USDA post officials to USDA officials in headquarters. Commerce provided us 21 emails that matched our request and an additional 20 emails from officials working throughout the United States. We analyzed the Commerce email communications to identify commonly asked questions or concerns about the existing guidance and actions the agencies should take to support U.S. tobacco companies or the tobacco industry. We also requested State cables from the eight countries in our sample sent between January 2013 and December 2017 that referenced at least 1 of the 10 U.S. tobacco companies with the highest revenues. We received and reviewed cables from six of these countries. We also conducted a literature search to identify instances in which U.S. government officials may have conducted activities addressed by the interagency tobacco guidance cable. To identify relevant articles, such as trade or industry articles, we searched various databases, including ProQuest and Nexus. From these sources, we identified one article relevant to our research objective. We performed these searches in December 2017 and searched for articles published from January 2013 to December 2017. We also interviewed representatives of the tobacco control community and business associations to obtain their perspectives concerning U.S. government support for tobacco exports and U.S. government interactions with U.S. tobacco companies. Specifically, we interviewed the World Health Organization (WHO), four global or regional tobacco control nongovernmental organizations, and several local nongovernmental organizations in two countries in our scope. In addition, we interviewed officials from the local American Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.- Association of Southeast Asian Nations Business Council in two countries. The information obtained from these interviews is neither generalizable nor reflects the experiences of all tobacco control organizations or business associations, but it does provide insights into these officials\u2019 experiences. We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to December 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The United States exported over $2.1 billion in tobacco and tobacco products in 2017. Figure 1 shows how tobacco exports fluctuated from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, total tobacco exports have ranged from a high of approximately $2.4 billion in 2007 to a low of about $1.7 billion in 2012. U.S. tobacco exports to Asia have decreased by 68 percent over the past 11 years, whereas exports to North America have increased 10-fold (see fig. 2). Most of the decrease in exports to Asia is attributable to reduced exports to Japan, which fell 95 percent from 2007 to 2017. Most of the increases in exports to North America are attributable to Canada, which accounted for approximately 40 percent of total U.S. tobacco exports in 2017. David B.

                "The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco use kills over 7 million people each year, more than tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria combined. Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take\u2014such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies\u2014and the types of actions they should not take\u2014such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. GAO recommends that (1) State and USDA include information about the funding restrictions and guidance in training materials for relevant employees and (2) State, in consultation with Commerce and USDA, assess and update the interagency guidance cable, as needed, on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas. State and USDA concurred with the recommendations."

            "context": "The DRC is a vast, mineral-rich nation with an estimated population of about 83 million people and an area that is roughly one-quarter the size of the United States, according to the United Nations. Figure 1 shows the DRC\u2019s provinces and adjoining countries. Since gaining its independence from Belgium in 1960, the DRC has undergone political upheaval and armed conflict. From 1998 to 2003, the DRC and eight other African countries were involved in what has become known as \u201cAfrica\u2019s World War,\u201d which resulted in a death toll of an estimated 5 million people in the DRC, according to the U.S. Department of State (State). The eastern DRC has continued to be plagued by violence, often perpetrated against civilians by illegal armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. Notably, in 2012, an illegal armed group occupied the city of Goma and other cities in the eastern DRC and clashed with the Congolese national army. During this time, the United Nations reported numerous cases of sexual violence against civilians, including women and children, which were perpetrated by armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. In 2017, the United Nations reported that serious violations of human rights remain widespread in the DRC, including continued acts of sexual violence by government security forces as well as nonstate armed groups. Various industries, particularly manufacturing industries, use the four conflict minerals specifically named in the Dodd-Frank Act\u2014tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold\u2014in a wide variety of products. For example, tin is used to solder metal pieces and is also found in food packaging, steel coatings on automobile parts, and some plastics. Tungsten is used in automobile manufacturing, drill bits and cutting tools, and other industrial manufacturing tools and is the primary component of filaments in incandescent light bulbs. Most tantalum is used to manufacture capacitors that enable energy storage in electronic products such as cell phones and computers or to produce alloy additives used in turbines in jet engines. Gold is held as bullion by central bank reserves and used in making jewelry and also in the electronics industry, for example, to manufacture cell phones and laptops. In August 2012, SEC adopted its conflict minerals disclosure rule in response to Section 1502(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The act required that SEC promulgate disclosure and reporting regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals originating from the DRC and covered countries. In the summary section of the adopting release for the rule, SEC noted that to accomplish the goal of helping to end the human rights abuses in the DRC caused by the conflict, Congress chose to use the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s disclosure requirements to bring greater public awareness of the sources of companies\u2019 conflict minerals and to promote the exercise of due diligence on conflict mineral supply chains. The SEC disclosure rule addresses the four conflict minerals named in the Dodd-Frank Act from the DRC and covered countries. The rule outlines a process for companies to follow, as applicable, to comply with the rule (see app. II). The process broadly requires a company to 1. determine whether it manufactures, or contracts to be manufactured, products with \u201cnecessary\u201d conflict minerals; 2. conduct a reasonable country-of-origin inquiry (RCOI) concerning the origin of those conflict minerals; and 3. exercise due diligence, if appropriate, to determine the source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals, adhering to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework, if such a framework is available for these necessary conflict minerals. If companies choose to disclose that their products are \u201cDRC conflict free,\u201d the SEC disclosure rule requires companies to obtain an independent private-sector audit (IPSA). Our review of companies\u2019 conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, a similar number of companies filed conflict minerals disclosures as in 2015 and 2016. Based on our review of a generalizable sample, we found that almost all companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures in 2017 reported performing inquiries about their conflict minerals\u2019 country of origin, similar to the results we previously reported for 2016 and 2015. In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated challenges in determining the country of origin. Our review of company filings found that almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country- of-origin inquires, reported performing it. SEC issued revised guidance in April 2017, indicating that the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance would not recommend enforcement action if companies did not report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures\u2014almost as many companies as filed in 2016 and 2015 (1,230 and 1,281 respectively). Our analysis of a generalizable sample of filings found that an estimated 90 percent of the companies that filed in 2017 were domestic and an estimated 10 percent were foreign companies, similar to the domestic-to-foreign ratio we found in 2016 and 2015. While not all companies reported the minerals used, of those that disclosed this information, an estimated 69 percent reported using tin, 54 percent reported using tantalum, 59 percent reported using tungsten, and 63 percent reported using gold, figures that are similar to the percentages reported in 2016. Our analysis of a generalizable sample of 2017 filings found that, as in 2016 and 2015, almost all companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures indicated that they performed country-of-origin inquiries. Specifically, an estimated 100 percent of the companies reported that they performed such an inquiry, similar to the percentages that we estimated reported doing so in 2016 and 2015. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from covered countries\u2014similar to the estimate of 49 percent in 2016 and in 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see fig. 2). In the filings we reviewed, many companies indicated they had taken actions to improve their data collection processes, such as gathering missing information about their supply chains and working with suppliers to encourage conflict-free sourcing. In interviews, representatives of selected companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures in 2017 and other industry participants noted that (1) awareness among suppliers about the use of conflict minerals had continued to increase and (2) the process for collecting data on supply chains had become more routine and standardized. However, as in prior years, our review of filings found that most companies reported challenges in determining the country of origin of conflict minerals, in part due to lack of access to suppliers and complex supply chains involving many suppliers and processing facilities. Our review of company filings found that almost all companies that were required, as a result of their country-of-origin inquires, to conduct due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals in their products reported doing so. In 2017, an estimated 96 percent reported conducting due diligence, compared with 96 and 97 percent in 2016 and 2015 respectively. An estimated 87 percent of companies in 2017 reported using a due diligence framework prescribed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidance for conducting due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals in their products. That result is comparable to an estimated 92 percent that we reported in 2016 and an estimated 95 percent that we reported in 2015. The remaining 13 percent of the companies that reported conducting due diligence in 2017 did not specify a framework for their due diligence activities. After conducting due diligence, an estimated 37 percent of the companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with an estimated 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. An estimated 47 percent of the companies in 2017 reported that they could not definitively confirm the source of the conflict minerals in their products, compared with an estimated 55 and 67 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. However, as in previous years, almost all of the companies that reported conducting due diligence in 2017 reported that they could not determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefited armed groups. Four companies in our sample reported determining that the minerals in their products did not finance or benefit armed groups in covered countries, and declared some products \u201cDRC- conflict free.\u201d Three of these companies included the required independent private-sector audit (IPSA) report, and one company did not include an IPSA report. Overall, a total of 16 companies filed an IPSA report in 2017, compared with 19 in 2016. In April 2017, the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance issued revised guidance indicating that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if companies did not report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements. The SEC disclosure rule requires companies, if applicable, to report on their due diligence in a conflict minerals report (see app. II for additional detail on the disclosure requirements). SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance staff told us that they received inquiries from a small number of companies about the filing process for 2017. In response to these inquiries, these staff noted that they advised companies that the companies had the flexibility to determine whether or not to report on their due diligence and to report their country-of-origin inquiry findings in either the Form SD or in a conflict minerals report. However, the Division of Corporation Finance staff also told us that, regardless of the division\u2019s revised guidance, the SEC could still initiate enforcement action if companies do not report on their due diligence, as required by the SEC disclosure rule. In our sample, three companies cited the updated guidance and other statements issued by the SEC in their filings as a rationale for not reporting on due diligence activities. In interviews, representatives of some companies and other industry participants told us that even though the revised guidance and other statements made by the SEC raised some uncertainty about the filing process, generally, companies plan to continue to report similar conflict minerals disclosure information. We identified two new population-based surveys since our last report related to sexual violence in Burundi and Uganda published in 2018; the most recent information for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016. We also identified some new case-file data on sexual violence in the DRC; however, as we reported previously, case-file data on sexual violence are not suitable for estimating an overall rate of sexual violence. We identified two new population-based surveys related to sexual violence that were conducted in Uganda and Burundi in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and whose results were published in 2018. The Uganda Demographic and Health Survey was conducted from June to December 2016 by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics with technical assistance from ICF International. The survey estimated that 12.7 percent of women nationwide, ages 15-49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 21.9 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. In addition, 4 percent of men nationwide, ages 15-49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 8.3 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. The Burundi Demographic and Health Survey was conducted from October of 2016 to March of 2017 by the Burundi Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies with technical assistance from ICF International. The survey estimated that 12.7 percent of women nationwide, ages 15- 49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 23.1 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. In addition, 1.9 percent of men nationwide, ages 15-49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 6.1 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. The most recent information on the rate of sexual violence for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016 and is discussed in our previous reports. Figure 3 shows the publication dates for the population-based surveys with data on rates of sexual violence in the eastern DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi that have been published since 2007. State and United Nations entities have provided additional case-file information about instances of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. State\u2019s annual country reports on human rights practices provided the following case-file data pertaining to sexual violence in the DRC and Burundi: DRC. In 2017, the UN documented 267 adult victims and 171 child victims, including two boys, of sexual violence in conflict. This violence was perpetrated by illegal armed groups as well as state security forces and civilians and was concentrated in North Kivu Province and in the Kasai region, according to State. Burundi. One government organization\u2014Humara Center\u2014 responsible for investigating cases of sexual violence and rape received 197 cases of sexual and gender-based violence through early December 2017, according to State. Observers stated many women were reluctant to report rape, in part due to fear of reprisal, according to State. In addition, UN entities reported the following case-file data about sexual violence in the DRC: DRC. In 2017, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC verified 195 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, with illegal armed groups responsible for 80 percent of the cases and DRC security forces responsible for the remaining 20 percent. United Nations officials we interviewed raised concerns about a resurgence of sexual violence in certain regions in the DRC due to a variety of factors, including political instability arising from the government\u2019s postponement of the presidential election originally scheduled to take place in November 2016. We provided a draft of this report to the SEC, State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development for comment. SEC provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. State and USAID did not provide comments. We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees and to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Secretary of State, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The report is also available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8612 or gianopoulosk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. In this report, we provide information about (1) companies\u2019 disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries published in 2017 and early 2018. To examine the fourth annual company disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 in response to the SEC disclosure rule, we downloaded the specialized disclosure reports (Form SD) and conflict minerals reports (CMR) from SEC\u2019s publically available Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database in September 2017. We downloaded 1,165 filings identified as Form SDs and the CMRs included in EDGAR. To review the completeness and accuracy of the EDGAR database, we reviewed relevant documentation, interviewed knowledgeable SEC officials, and reviewed prior GAO reports on internal controls related to SEC\u2019s financial systems. We determined that the EDGAR database was sufficiently reliable for identifying the universe of SD filings. We reviewed the conflict minerals section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and the requirements of the SEC disclosure rule to develop a data collection instrument (DCI) that guided our analysis of Form SDs and CMRs that contain the information disclosed by the filing companies. Our DCI was not a compliance review of the Form SDs and CMRs. The questions were written in both yes-no and multiple-choice formats. An analyst reviewed the Form SDs and CMRs and recorded responses to the DCI for all of the companies in the sample. A second analyst also reviewed the Form SDs and CMRs and verified the responses recorded by the first analyst. Analysts met to discuss and resolve any discrepancies. We randomly sampled 100 Form SDs from a population of 1,165 to create estimates generalizable to the population of all companies that filed. All estimates based on our sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percentage points or less at the 95-percent confidence level. Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95-percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. We also attended an industry conference on conflict minerals and spoke with company representatives to provide additional perspective. To address our second objective, we identified and assessed any information on sexual violence in the eastern DRC and the three adjoining countries\u2014Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi\u2014that had been published or otherwise had become available in 2017 and early 2018. We discussed the collection of sexual violence\u2013related data in the DRC and adjoining countries, including population-based survey data and case-file data, during interviews with U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development officials and with representatives of nongovernmental organizations and researchers whom we interviewed for our prior review of sexual violence rates in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries. We also interviewed officials from the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General in New York on Sexual Violence in Conflict. In addition, we conducted Internet searches to identify new academic articles containing any additional information on sexual violence published in 2017 and early 2018. We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to June 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) conflict minerals disclosure rule requires certain companies to file a specialized disclosure report, known as the Form SD, if the company manufactures, or contracts to have manufactured, a product or products containing conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or the production of those products. The rule also requires each company, as applicable, to provide a description of the measures the company took to exercise due diligence in determining the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals, the facilities used to process them, their country of origin, and the efforts made to determine the mine or location of origin with the greatest possible specificity. Form SD provides general instructions for filing conflict minerals disclosures and specifies the information that companies must provide. Companies were required to file under the rule for the first time by June 2, 2014, and annually thereafter on May 31. Figure 4 shows the SEC\u2019s flowchart summarizing the conflict minerals disclosure rule.

                "Over the past decade, the United States and the international community have sought to improve security in the DRC. In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d\u2014 in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures\u2014about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries\u2014similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products \u201cDRC conflict-free,\u201d and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys. For Uganda, 22 percent of women and 9 percent of men reported they had experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. For Burundi, 23 percent of women and 6 percent of men reported they had experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. The most recent information on the rate of sexual violence for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016 and is discussed in our previous GAO reports."

            "context": "T he federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where the responsible mine operators are not able to pay. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury, which contains federal receipts not earmarked for a specific purpose. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. This decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. This report provides background information and policy options to help inform the debate surrounding the coal excise tax rate, and other considerations related to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The report begins with an overview of the federal black lung program, providing information on black lung disease and benefits under the program. The report proceeds to examine Black Lung Disability Trust Fund revenues, focusing on the coal excise tax and its history. The report closes with a discussion of policy options, evaluating various revenue- and benefits-related policy options that could improve the fiscal outlook of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is used to finance the payment of federal Black Lung Program benefits under Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) when a responsible coal operator does not meet its obligations under the law to pay benefits. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) is an interstitial lung disease caused by the inhalation of coal dust. Like in other types of pneumoconioses, the inhalation of coal dust results in the scarring of the lung tissue and affects the gas-exchanging ability of the lungs to remove carbon dioxide and take oxygen into the bloodstream. Exposure to coal dust over an extended period of time can lead to CWP and continued exposure can lead to the progression from the early stages of CWP referred to as \"simple CWP,\" to more advanced stages of scarring referred to as \"complicated CWP\" or progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). There is no cure for CWP and PMF. CWP can lead to loss of lung function, the need for lung transplantation, and premature death. CWP can be identified by observing light spots, or opacities, in x-ray images of the lungs and can be classified using guidelines established by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Despite technological advances in mining dust control, mandatory chest x-rays for miners, free CWP surveillance offered to miners by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the enactment of numerous pieces of mine safety and health legislation, and the promulgation and enforcement of mine safety and health standards by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), CWP persists in American coal miners, especially those in the Appalachian region. After reductions in rates of PMF in the 1990s, this advanced form of CWP has recently been found in Central Appalachia at rates not seen since the early 1970s. In 2017 researchers discovered, among coal miners mostly living in Kentucky and Virginia and served by three federally funded Black Lung Clinics in Virginia, what may be the largest cluster of PMF ever recorded. This cluster of miners with PMF includes a relatively high number of miners with less than 20 years of mining experience as well as cases of PMF in current miners. The occurrence of this advanced stage of CWP in short-tenured and current miners is noteworthy since MSHA standards require that any miner with evidence of CWP be given the option, without loss of compensation or other penalty, to work in an area of the mining operation in which the average concentration of coal dust in the air is continuously maintained at or below an established level that is lower than the permissible exposure level for all miners with the goal of preventing the progression of CWP. The federal Black Lung Program was created in 1969 with the enactment of Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (Coal Act, P.L. 91-173, later renamed the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 by P.L. 95-164 ). Section 401 of the Coal Act provides the congressional justification for the federal Black Lung Program and cites the lack of benefits for disability and death caused by CWP provided by existing state workers' compensation systems as justification for the creation of a federal program. This section also states that the program is intended to be a cooperative effort between the federal government and the states. The Coal Act also established mandatory safety and health standards for coal mines, including standards limiting exposure of miners to coal dust and giving miners with CWP the option of being moved, without loss of compensation or penalty, to an area of the mine with lower dust concentrations. The Coal Act was later amended by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 (BLBA, P.L. 92-303). The Coal Act established Part B of the federal Black Lung Program to provide cash benefits to miners totally disabled due to CWP and to the survivors of miners who die from CWP. Part B only applies to cases filed on or before December 31, 1973. Part B benefits are paid out of general revenue and were initially administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Today, with the exception of a small number of pending appellate cases, Part B benefits are administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). The Coal Act established Part C of the Federal Black Lung Program for cases filed after December 31, 1973, and was later amended by the BLBA. Under Part C of the BLBA, all claims for benefits for disability or death due to CWP are to be filed with each state's workers' compensation system, but only if such systems have been determined by DOL as providing benefits that are equivalent to or greater than the cash benefits provided by the federal government under Part B of the BLBA and the medical benefits provided to disabled longshore and harbor workers under the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). If a state's workers' compensation system is not determined by DOL to meet these standards, then Part C benefits are to be paid by the each miner's coal employer, or, if no such employer is available to pay benefits, by the federal government. In 1973, Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia submitted their state workers' compensation laws to DOL for approval, but were denied. To date, no state workers' compensation system has been approved by DOL under Part C of the BLBA. Because no state's workers' compensation system has been determined to be sufficient to pay benefits under Part C, each operator of an underground coal mine is responsible for the payment of benefits to that operator's miners. Operators are required to provide for these benefits either by purchasing insurance for benefits or through self-insurance approved by DOL. A self-insured operator is required to purchase an indemnity bond or provide another form of security (such as a deposit of negotiable securities in a Federal Reserve Bank or the establishment of a trust) in an amount specified by DOL. In order to be approved for self-insurance, federal regulations require that a mine operator have been in business for at least the three previous years and have average assets over the previous three years that exceed current liabilities by the sum of expected benefit payments and annual premiums on the indemnity bond. When a claim for benefits is approved, benefits are to be paid by the \"responsible\" operator, which is generally the last coal operator to employ the miner. If a company has acquired the assets of a mine operator, then that company is considered a \"successor operator\" and is responsible for the payment of claims related to the original operator. The federal government pays benefits in cases in which the responsible operator no longer exists and has no successor operator, or is unable to pay benefits. The federal government pays benefits when an operator has not made payment within 30 days of a determination of eligibility or when benefits are otherwise due to be paid. Initially, under Part C of the Coal Act, these federal benefits were paid out of general revenue. However, pursuant to the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-227 ), these benefits are now paid from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund established by this law and primarily financed by an excise tax on coal. If a responsible operator can later be identified, the trust fund is authorized by law to seek to recover from this operator the amount of benefits paid by the trust fund and any interest earned on these amounts. The trust fund is also used for the following federal Black Lung Program-related expenses: the payment of benefits for miners whose last coal mine employment was before January 1, 1970; reimbursement to the Treasury for the costs of Part C benefits paid from general revenue before April 1, 1978, for periods of benefit eligibility after January 1, 1974; the repayment and payment of interest on advances made from the general fund to the trust fund; the payment of administrative expenses related to Part C of the BLBA and the coal excise tax incurred after March 1, 1978; and the reimbursement of coal operators who paid Part C benefits before April 1, 1978, for miners whose last coal mine employment ended before January 1, 1970. A miner is eligible for benefits if that miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment. The survivors of a miner are eligible for benefits if the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment. Benefits are only available to miners and their survivors. The BLBA defines a miner as any individual who works or has worked in or around a coal mine or coal preparation facility in the extraction or preparation of coal. Such term also includes an individual who works or has worked in coal mine construction or transportation in or around a coal mine, to the extent such individual was exposed to coal dust as a result of such employment. Thus, other workers who may be exposed to coal dust in their work, such as railroad workers or workers at coal-fired power plants are not eligible for benefits. Persons who live near coal mines or power plants are also not eligible for benefits even if they are exposed to coal dust. In addition, while a miner's family members may receive benefits as survivors and the number of family members can increase the amount of a miner's monthly benefits, family members may not claim benefits on their own due to exposure to coal dust in the home such as from cleaning the miner's soiled clothing. The BLBA defines pneumoconiosis for the purposes of benefit eligibility as \"a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\" The BLBA directs the Secretary of Labor to develop, through regulations, standards for determining if a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or died due to pneumoconiosis. The federal Black Lung Program regulations provide that the definition of pneumoconiosis includes medical or \"clinical\" pneumoconiosis and statutory or \"legal\" pneumoconiosis. Clinical pneumoconiosis is defined as follows: \"Clinical pneumoconiosis\" consists of those diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconioses, i.e., the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment. This definition includes, but is not limited to, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, anthracosilicosis, anthracosis, anthrosilicosis, massive pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis or silicotuberculosis, arising out of coal mine employment. Legal pneumoconiosis is defined as any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment. This definition includes, but is not limited to, any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment. Through these definitions, DOL has established that benefits are available not just to miners with CWP, but also to those miners with other respiratory diseases arising out of coal mine employment such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) even though these diseases are not pneumoconioses and may be linked to other factors unrelated to exposure to coal dust such as cigarette smoking. The BLBA contains five presumptions used to determine if a miner is eligible for black lung benefits. Three of these presumptions are \"rebuttable,\" meaning that, in the absence of any contrary evidence, eligibility is presumed. One presumption is \"irrebutable\" and eligibility for Black Lung program benefits is established if the statutory requirements of the presumption are met. Three of these presumptions apply to current Black Lung Program claims while two apply only to cases filed before the end of 1981. Table 1 provides a summary of the following five presumptions provided by the BLBA. 1. A rebuttable presumption that the pneumoconiosis of a miner who was employed in mining for at least 10 years was caused by his or her employment. 2. A rebuttable presumption that the death of a miner who worked in mining for at least 10 years and who died of any respirable disease, was due to pneumoconiosis. This presumption does not apply to claims filed on or after January 1, 1982, the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981 ( P.L. 97-119 ). 3. An irrebuttable presumption that a miner with any chronic lung disease which meets certain statutory tests or diagnoses is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or died due to pneumoconiosis. 4. A rebuttable presumption that a miner employed in mining for at least 15 years, and who has a chest x-ray that is interpreted as negative with respect to certain statutory standards but who has other evidence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or died due to pneumoconiosis. This presumption may only be rebutted by the Secretary of Labor establishing that the miner does not or did not have pneumoconiosis or that the miner's respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of connection to mine employment. 5. A presumption that a miner who died on or before March 1, 1978, and who was employed in mining for at least 25 years before June 30, 1971, died due to pneumoconiosis, unless it is established that at the time of the miner's death, he or she was not at least partially disabled due to pneumoconiosis. This presumption does not apply to claims filed on or after June 29, 1982, which is 180 days after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981. This presumption is not listed in the law as either rebuttable or irrebuttable. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), P.L. 111-148 ) included two provisions that amended the BLBA to reinstate one of the eligibility presumptions and a provision affecting survivors' benefits. The effect of these changes was to increase the opportunity to establish eligibility through the statutory presumptions and make it easier for certain survivors to receive benefits. Pursuant to Section 202(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, the fourth presumption did not apply to cases filed on or after January 1, 1982. Section 1556(a) of the ACA removed the prohibition on applying the fourth presumption to cases filed on or after January 1, 1982. It is expected that this ACA provision will increase the number of miners eligible for benefits. The BLBA provides that, for Part C claims, the survivors of a miner who was determined to be eligible to receive benefits at the time of his or her death are not required to file new claims for benefits or revalidate any claim for benefits, thus permitting the payment of survivors' benefits in these cases even if the miner's death was not caused by pneumoconiosis. Pursuant to Section 203(a)(6) of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, this provision did not apply to claims filed on or after January 1, 1982. Section 1556(b) of the ACA removed from this provision the exception for claims filed on or after January 1, 1982. It is expected that this ACA provision will increase the number of survivors eligible for benefits. The amendments to the BLBA provided in Section 1556 of the ACA apply to any claims filed under Part B or C of the act after January 1, 2005, that were pending on or after March 23, 2010, the date of enactment of the ACA. Eligible miners receiving benefits under Parts B and C are entitled to medical coverage for their pneumoconiosis and related disability. This medical coverage is provided at no cost to the miner and can generally be obtained from the miner's choice of medical providers. Eligible miners are also entitled to cash disability benefits. The basic benefit rate is set at 37.5% of the basic pay rate at GS-2, Step 1, on the federal pay schedule without any locality adjustment. If the miner has one dependent (a spouse or minor child) the miner is eligible for a benefit of 150% of the basic benefit. A miner with two dependents is eligible for 175% of the basic benefit and a miner with three or more dependents is eligible for 200% of the basic benefit. Benefits may also be paid to the divorced spouse of a miner if the marriage lasted at least 10 years and the divorced spouse was dependent on the miner for at least half of the spouse's support at the time of the miner's disability. A child is considered a dependent until the child marries, or reaches age 18, unless the child is either disabled using the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) definition of disability or is under the age of 23 and a full-time student. The benefit rates are adjusted whenever there are changes to the federal employee pay schedules, but are not separately adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of living. Table 2 provides the benefit rates for 2019. Benefits are offset by state workers' compensation or other benefits paid on account of the miner's disability or death due to pneumoconiosis. Part C benefits, but not Part B benefits, are considered workers' compensation for the purposes of reducing a miner's SSDI benefits. The total amount paid in cash disability benefits has fallen over time, as illustrated in Figure 1 . More is paid in cash disability benefits than is paid in medical benefits. Certain survivors of a miner whose death was due to pneumoconiosis are eligible for cash benefits. In the case of a surviving spouse or divorced spouse, the spouse's benefit is equal to what the miner would have received and is based on the number of dependents of the spouse as provided in Table 2 . If there is no surviving spouse, then benefits are awarded to the surviving minor children in equal shares. If there are no surviving minor children, then benefits can be paid to the miner's dependent parents or dependent siblings. If there are no eligible survivors, no benefits are paid upon the miner's death and benefits do not go to the miner's estate or to any other person, including a person named by the miner in a will. The number of miners and survivors receiving benefits has declined over time, as illustrated in Figure 2 . The primary revenue source for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is a per-ton excise tax on coal. Historically, the coal excise tax has not generated enough revenue to meet the trust fund's obligations. Thus, additional funds have been provided from the general fund of the Treasury. The general fund includes governmental receipts not earmarked for a specific purpose, the proceeds of general borrowing, and is used for general governmental expenditures. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 4121 imposes the black lung excise tax (BLET) on sales or use of domestically mined coal. Generally, a producer that sells the coal is liable for the tax. Producers that use their own domestically mined coal, such as integrated utilities or steel companies, are also liable for the tax. The tax rate depends on how coal is mined. Effective January 1, 2019, the tax on underground-mined coal is the lesser of (1) $0.50 per ton, or (2) 2% of the sale price. The tax on surface-mined coal is the lesser of (1) $0.25 per ton, or (2) 2% of the sales price. Before 2019, the tax rates were $1.10 per ton for coal from underground mines or $0.55 per ton for coal from surface mines, with the tax being no more than 4.4% of the sale price. In FY2017, $229 million was collected on coal mined underground (see Figure 3 ). Nearly all of this coal was taxed at the $1.10 per ton rate. In FY2017, $200 million was collected on surface-mined coal. Just over half of this coal was taxed at the $0.55 per ton rate, with the rest subject to the 4.4% of sales price maximum tax. On January 1, 2019, the BLET rates declined to their current levels. The rates that took effect January 1, 2019, would also have taken effect if the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund had repaid, with interest, all amounts borrowed from the General Fund of the Treasury. The tax is imposed on \"coal from mines located in the United States\" and does not apply to imported coal. The tax is designed to support the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund for domestic miners. Very little domestically consumed coal is imported. The BLET also does not apply to exported coal under the Export Clause of the United States Constitution. A credit or refund can be claimed if coal is taxed before it is exported. Black lung excise tax collections have generally declined in recent years (see Figure 3 ). In FY2009, more than $650 million was collected from the BLET. In FY2017, collections were about $429 million. The decline in BLET collections follows the general decline in U.S. coal production. As the price of coal rose in the 2000s, coal mined underground tended to pay the tax at a fixed rate of $1.10 per ton, as opposed to paying 4.4% of the sales price. In the years beyond 2018, coal excise tax receipts are expected to fall sharply, reflecting the decrease in the coal excise tax rate (see Figure 3 ). The excise tax on coal was established to help ensure the coal industry shared in the social costs imposed by black lung disease. Over time, the rate of the tax has been increased, in an effort to provide sufficient revenue to meet this objective. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-227 ) first imposed the Section 4121 excise tax on coal. When enacted, the tax was $0.50 per ton for coal from underground mines, and $0.25 per ton for coal from surface mines. The tax was limited to 2% of the sales price. The tax was effective for sales after March 31, 1978. Before P.L. 95-227 was enacted there was considerable debate surrounding how black lung benefits programs should be financed. Various mechanisms to shift the costs of the black lung benefits program to the coal industry and its customers were considered. These debates ultimately led to the establishment of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and the related excise tax on coal. There was also debate about how to structure the proposed tax. Some suggested a graduated tax, with higher rates imposed on coal with a higher British thermal unit (Btu) content, as such coal was believed to be more likely to cause black lung disease. There were concerns, however, that such a tax could be difficult to administer. Other proposals suggested that coal be subject to a uniform rate, with coal mined from underground deposits subject to a higher rate than other coal (including lignite). A concern with this approach was that coal prices vary substantially per ton for different types of coal (lignite is less expensive than anthracite), meaning that the tax as a percent of the sales price could differ substantially across different types of coal. One answer to this concern is to impose an ad valorem tax, or a tax based on the sales price. Another approach that was considered was to impose a \"premium rate\" at a level that would fully finance the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, giving authority to the Department of Labor to adjust the fee as necessary. The tax as enacted was the lesser of the per-unit price or the ad valorem rate of 2%. In the early 1980s, it was observed that coal excise tax revenues were not sufficient to meet the trust fund's obligations. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-119 ) doubled the excise tax rates to $1.00 per ton for coal from underground mines, and $0.50 per ton for coal from surface mines, not to exceed 4% of the sales price. The higher rates were effective January 1, 1982. The doubled rates were temporary, and scheduled to revert to the previous rates on January 1, 1996. Further, the rates could be reduced earlier if the trust fund repaid all advances and interest from the general fund of the Treasury. A stated goal of this legislation was to eliminate the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's debt. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-272 ) again increased the BLET rates to $1.10 for underground-mined coal, and $0.55 for surface-mined coal, not to exceed 4.4% of the sales price. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-203 ) extended these rates through 2013. Increased excise tax rates on coal were again extended in 2008. Current-law rates were extended through 2018 as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343 ). When extending the increased rates, Congress reiterated the original intent of establishing trust fund financing for black lung benefits, observing that it is \"to reduce reliance on the Treasury and to recover costs from the mining industry.\" It was also observed that the program's expenses had continued to exceed revenues over time, and that the debt to the Treasury was not likely to be paid off by 2013. For these reasons, \"the Congress believe[d] that it [was] appropriate to continue the tax on coal at the increased rates beyond the expiration date.\" When receipts of the trust fund are less than expenditures, advances are appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund. These advances are repayable, and interest charged on these advances is also payable to the general fund. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-272 ) provided a five-year forgiveness of interest on debt owed to the Treasury's general fund. As a result, the principal amount of trust fund debt outstanding was relatively unchanged throughout the late 1980s. The moratorium on interest payments ended September 30, 1990. Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, the cumulative end-of-year debt of the trust fund grew, and the trust fund continued to receive repayable advances from the general fund to cover expenses. The trust fund was subject to financial restructuring when the current excise tax rate was extended until January 1, 2019, in EESA. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt was restructured in FY2009. Essentially, the partial forgiveness and restructuring allowed the trust fund to refinance outstanding repayable advances and unpaid interest on those advances. As a result of the partial forgiveness and refinancing, the cumulative debt was reduced from $10.4 billion at the end of FY2008 to $6.2 billion by the end of FY2009. At the time of the restructuring it was expected that the trust fund's debt would be fully eliminated by FY2040. The trust fund's cumulative debt has trended downward since the restructuring (see Figure 4 ). However, coal excise tax revenue has been less than anticipated in recent years. As a result, current projections suggest that the trust fund debt will rise over time when considering annual borrowing as well as legacy debt. The trust fund's debt is therefore not on a path to be eliminated. By FY2050, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects the trust fund's debt will be $15.4 billion without any changes in current policy. In addition to revenue from the BLET and repayable general fund advances, the trust fund receives revenue from the collection of certain fines, penalties, and interest paid by coal operators and miners and reimbursements from responsible operators. Part C of the BLBA authorizes the following fines and penalties for violations of the act: a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per day for a mine operator's failure to secure benefits through insurance or approved self-insurance; a fine of up to $1,000 upon conviction of the misdemeanor offense of knowingly destroying or transferring property of a mine operator with the intent to avoid the payment of benefits for which the mine operator is responsible; a fine of up to $1,000 upon conviction of the misdemeanor offense of making a false or misleading statement or representation for the purposes of obtaining benefits; and a civil penalty of up to $500 for a mine operator's failure to file a report on miners who are or may be entitled to benefits as required by DOL. The amount of these penalties and fines, as well as interest assessed, is paid into the trust fund. In FY2017, trust fund receipts from fines, penalties, and interest totaled $1.2 million. This is a small source of trust fund revenue relative to the coal excise tax, which generated $428.7 million in trust fund revenues in FY2017. The trust fund is authorized to begin paying benefits within 30 days if no responsible operator has begun payment. If, after paying benefits, DOL is able to identify a responsible operator, the trust fund may seek to collect from that operator the costs of benefits already paid by the trust fund and interest assessed on this amount. The amount of these collections is paid into the trust fund. In FY2017, $19.9 million was collected from responsible mine operators. The amount collected from responsible mine operators has fluctuated over time, but has averaged about 1% of total receipts since 1995. Various factors have contributed to the ongoing situation of trust fund expenditures exceeding trust fund revenues. Throughout the 1980s, black lung benefit payments and administrative expenditures exceeded trust fund revenue. As a result, the trust fund accumulated debt. As discussed above, over time, various efforts have been made to improve the fiscal condition of the trust fund. However, as of the end of FY2017, the trust fund remains in debt. The trust fund's cumulative debt at the end of FY2017 was $3.1 billion. The trust fund also borrowed $1.3 billion from the general fund that same year. Projections suggest that borrowing from the general fund will increase over the next few years, even as cumulative (or legacy) debt is paid down. Under the current excise tax rates, benefit payments and administrative expenses will be approximately equal to trust fund revenues in FY2020 through FY2022 (see Figure 5 ). However, revenues are not projected to be sufficient to repay debt, and expenses are projected to rise over time when debt and interest expenses are included. Specifically, by FY2022, it is projected that the trust fund will borrow $2.6 billion in repayable advances from the general fund. There are various policy options that Congress might consider to improve the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Broadly, increasing taxes on the coal industry (or maintaining 2018 rates) would pass the costs associated with paying black lung benefits onto the coal industry. Alternatively, forgiving trust fund interest or debt or financing black lung benefits out of general fund revenues would pass the costs of federal black lung benefits onto taxpayers in general. Another option would be to reduce federal black lung benefits. Additional revenue would likely need to be provided to the trust fund if the trust fund is to pay for past black lung benefits and maintain current benefit levels. Additional revenue may be needed even if past debt is forgiven (or assumed by the general fund), as anticipated trust fund revenues are not likely to be sufficient to cover anticipated trust fund expenditures. As discussed above, in the past, Congress and the President have opted to increase the excise tax on coal to address shortfalls in the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. These increased rates have been temporary, and scheduled to revert back to the reduced rate if the trust fund's debt is eliminated. Congress has chosen to extend the increased rates beyond their scheduled expiration when the trust fund is in debt. One option would be to extend 2018 rates.. The GAO projects that if 2018 coal excise tax rates are extended, the trust fund will have a debt of $4.5 billion in 2050 (see \"GAO Options for Improving Trust Fund Finances\" below). GAO projections suggest that increasing 2018 tax rates by 25% would eliminate the trust fund's debt, leaving the trust fund with a surplus of $0.6 billion in 2050. An alternative way to raise revenue from the coal industry is to scale back or eliminate various tax expenditures, or tax preferences, from which the coal industry benefits. For example, coal producers benefit from being able to expense exploration and development costs and are able to recover costs using percentage depletion (depletion based on revenue from the sale of the mineral asset) instead of cost depletion (depletion based on the amount of the mineral asset exhausted and the amount invested in the asset). The Obama Administration regularly proposed repealing these tax incentives as part of the Administration's annual budget. It could be difficult to assign the revenues raised via the repeal of tax benefits to the trust fund. With an excise tax, it is straightforward to identify the revenue generated by the tax and earmark the revenue for a trust fund. It is not as straightforward to determine the amount of revenue that is raised through the repeal of an income tax expenditure, or direct the additional revenue raised because a certain preference is no longer in the code to a trust fund. Repeal of coal-industry tax benefits could, however, be used to offset the cost of a one-time transfer from the general fund to the trust fund. Revenue from various sources, including the general fund, could be used to supplement trust fund revenue generated from current sources. General fund revenues are not earmarked for a specific purpose, and there is generally no direct link between the source of general fund revenue and the government good or service provided. Black lung benefits were paid out of general revenue before the trust fund was established in 1977. Trust funds are generally established when there is a link between the government benefits or services being provided and the revenue source funding those benefits or services. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was established because Congress believed that the costs of the part C black lung program should be borne by the coal industry. Financing black lung benefits with general fund revenue would weaken the link between the industry and black lung benefits, while reducing the burden on the industry associated with paying for black lung benefits. In the past the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's fiscal outlook has been improved through interest and debt forgiveness. As discussed above, in the late 1990s, there was a five-year forgiveness of interest on debt owed to the Treasury's general fund. More recently, debt was forgiven as part of the 2008 restructuring of the trust fund's debt. The GAO projects that if all current debt were forgiven, the trust fund would accumulate $2.3 billion in new debt by 2050. If all interest were forgiven, the trust fund debt is projected to be $5.8 billion by 2050. Forgiving the trust fund's interest or debt obligations would shift the burden of paying for black lung disability benefits from the coal industry to general taxpayers. However, a one-time appropriation to forgive interest or debt is a transparent option for satisfying the trust fund's obligations to the general fund. The primary expenditures of the trust fund are for the payment of Part C benefits to miners in cases in which there is no responsible operator. In order to reduce expenditures and improve the long-term financial health of the trust fund, Congress could consider several options to reduce the generosity and scope of benefits or increase the ability of the federal government to ensure that coal operators, even those who are in the bankruptcy process, pay benefits for their miners. A reduction in the amount of Part C benefits would result in lower Part C expenditures from both responsible coal operators and the trust fund. However, as compared to other workers' compensation benefits, Part C benefits are relatively low. The basic Part C benefit rate for a single miner is equal to 37.5% of the base rate of pay for federal employees at the GS-2, Step 1 level. For 2019 this benefit is just over $660 per month, or under $8,000 per year. In the majority of state workers' compensation programs, the basic benefit rate is set at two-thirds of the worker's pre-disability wage, subject to statutory minimums and maximums. The other workers' compensation programs administered by DOL, the LHWCA, and the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) use two-thirds of a worker's pre-disability wage as the basis for their benefits. A federal worker with a spouse or dependent in the FECA program is entitled to 75% of his or her pre-disability wage. The minimum benefit for total disability or death in the FECA program, 75% of GS-2, Step 1, is twice the amount of the Part C benefit rate. In addition, unlike the other federal workers' compensation programs and many state programs, there is no automatic adjustment to Part C benefits to reflect increases in the cost of living. Part C benefits instead increase only when federal pay rates are increased. The eligibility of miners and survivors to Part C benefits could be restricted to reduce expenditures from responsible operators and the trust fund. In 1981, Congress enacted several eligibility restrictions to miners and survivors as part of the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981, to address concerns about the financial insolvency of the trust fund. Specifically, this law removed the following three eligibility presumptions for new claims going forward: A rebuttable presumption that the death of a miner who worked in mining for at least 10 years and who died of any respirable disease, was due to pneumoconiosis (listed as presumption 2 in Table 1 ). A rebuttable presumption that a miner employed in mining for at least 15 years, and who has a chest x-ray that is interpreted as negative with respect to certain statutory standards but who has other evidence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, or died due to pneumoconiosis. This presumption may only be rebutted by the Secretary of Labor establishing that the miner does not or did not have pneumoconiosis or that the miner's respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of connection to mine employment (presumption 4 in Table 1 ). A presumption that a miner who died on or before March 1, 1978, and who was employed in mining for at least 25 years before June 30, 1971, died due to pneumoconiosis, unless it is established that at the time of the miner's death, he or she was not at least partially disabled due to pneumoconiosis (presumption 5 in Table 1 ). In addition to removing three of the five existing eligibility presumptions, the 1981 law also removed the right of the survivors of a miner who is determined to be eligible for Part C benefits at the time of his or her death to receive survivors' benefits without filing a new claim, thus permitting the payment of survivors' benefits in the case of a current beneficiary, even if the beneficiary's death is not proven to be linked to pneumoconiosis. Two of the restrictions put in place by the 1981 legislation were later removed by the ACA. The ACA reinstated the fourth eligibility presumption and expanded rights for survivors' benefits, thus expanding eligibility for both miners and certain survivors. Under Part C of the BLBA, the federal government may recover the costs of benefits, and interest accrued on those benefits, paid by the trust fund from identified responsible operators. In addition, Part C allows the federal government to place a lien on the property and rights to property of an operator that refuses to pay the benefits and interest it owes to the trust fund. In the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, this lien is to be treated in the same manner as a lien for taxes owed to the federal government. However, in a 2016 letter to the Comptroller General requesting a GAO review of the trust fund, Representatives Bobby Scott, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and Sander Levin, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, claimed that the number of current and potential bankruptcies among coal operators is placing stress on the trust fund. Representatives Scott and Levin cited the example of Patriot Coal which, according to their letter, transferred $62 million in Part C liabilities to the trust fund when it became insolvent. In addition, this letter claims that insolvent coal operators may be able to avoid trust fund liens by continuing to make benefit payments until after the court in their bankruptcy cases has approved the sale of their assets to another company. Because the original company was never in default of its payments, no lien was filed, and these assets were able to be purchased by another company without any lien or future liability to the trust fund. Congress may examine the issue of the impact of coal operator bankruptcies and the interaction of bankruptcy law and the BLBA's lien provisions, to strengthen both the federal government's ability to ensure that responsible operators are paying for benefits and reduce the benefit expenditures of the trust fund.",
            "answers": [
                "The federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where responsible mine operators are not able to pay. In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."

            "context": "Global defense posture is an enabler of U.S. defense activities and military operations overseas and is a central means of defining and communicating U.S. strategic interests to allies, partners, and adversaries. It is driven by a hierarchy of national-level and DOD-specific guidance, which includes the National Defense Strategy and the National Military Strategy. Under DOD Instruction 3000.12, global defense posture includes three elements: Forces: forward stationed or rotationally deployed forces, U.S. military capabilities, equipment, and units (assigned or allocated). Footprint: networks of U.S. foreign and overseas locations, infrastructure, facilities, land, and prepositioned equipment. Agreements: treaties and access, transit, support, and status- protection agreements and arrangements with allies and partners that set the terms regarding the U.S. military\u2019s presence within the territory of the host country. EUCOM is one of six geographic combatant commands and is responsible for missions in all of Europe, large portions of Asia, parts of the Middle East, and the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans (see figure 1). EUCOM evaluates the adequacy of posture in Europe to support relevant plans and achieve military objectives. EUCOM shares responsibility with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense for U.S. military relations with allies and partners in Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The number of U.S. military sites located in EUCOM\u2019s area of responsibility and the number of military personnel assigned to Europe have decreased substantially since the end of the Cold War, and two heavy combat brigades had been deactivated by the end of fiscal year 2014. As of May 2016, EUCOM supported one airborne infantry brigade and one Stryker brigade, as well as approximately 62,000 military personnel across approximately 250 sites. Since 2009, we have reported on issues related to DOD\u2019s efforts to estimate and report on the total cost of its global defense posture. In 2009, we identified weaknesses in DOD\u2019s approach for adjusting its global defense posture and recommended, among other things, that DOD issue guidance for estimating total costs for global defense posture and modify its annual report to Congress to include the total cost to complete each planned posture initiative. In February 2011, we reported that EUCOM lacked comprehensive cost data in a key posture planning document and that therefore decision makers lacked critical information that they needed to make fully informed posture decisions. We recommended that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff revise the Joint Staff\u2019s posture planning guidance to include direction on how the combatant commands should analyze costs and benefits when considering changes to posture and to require that posture plans include comprehensive cost estimates. DOD agreed with the recommendations in both reports and subsequently took steps to implement them. In June 2012, we reported that DOD did not fully understand the cost implications of two posture initiatives in Europe\u2014including its decision to return two heavy brigades from Europe to the United States\u2014and that key posture planning documents did not completely and consistently include cost data. We recommended that DOD fully estimate the cost implications of these two initiatives, clarify components\u2019 roles and responsibilities for estimating costs, and develop a standard reporting format for cost data. DOD generally agreed with our recommendations and has taken steps to implement two of them. Following the President\u2019s June 2014 announcement of ERI, EUCOM identified five lines of effort that it would pursue under ERI, as described in table 1. Three of ERI\u2019s lines of effort are expected to enhance DOD\u2019s posture in Europe. For example, DOD is using ERI to increase the forces present in Europe by rotating an armored brigade combat team and elements of a combat aviation brigade to Europe every nine months. DOD also plans to enhance its footprint in Europe by using ERI funding to make infrastructure improvements and establish locations for prepositioned equipment. Finally, in order to implement ERI\u2019s lines of effort and support U.S. activities, DOD is partnering with the State Department to negotiate host nation agreements that, among other things, establish protections for U.S. military personnel and provide DOD the authority to improve host nation installations and infrastructure. DOD is also supporting additional exercises and training to improve interoperability with partner countries while providing them with the capability and capacity to defend themselves, but these efforts are not expected to affect DOD\u2019s long-term posture in Europe. Since 2014, DOD has expanded ERI\u2019s objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to posture in Europe. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, ERI\u2019s objective was to provide short-term reassurance to allies, and the initiative had little funding for long-term enhancements to posture. DOD focused its efforts on bolstering the security and capacity of NATO allies and partners by funding training, conducting exercises, and temporarily rotating Army and Air Force units to Eastern Europe. In fiscal year 2017, DOD expanded ERI\u2019s objectives to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. Recognizing that ERI\u2019s expanded objectives would require DOD to alter its posture in Europe, DOD has requested increased ERI funding. DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion in ERI funding for posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017; about $3.2 billion of this was requested for use in fiscal years 2017. During the time of our review, EUCOM had identified a need for additional funding over the next several years for additional posture enhancements in Europe. Specific details about EUCOM\u2019s future posture plans and funding requirements were omitted because they are classified. DOD has requested increased funding to support planned enhancements to all three posture elements\u2014forces, footprint, and agreements\u2014in Europe: Force deployments to Eastern Europe: In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Army deployed armored brigade combat teams to Eastern Europe to provide short-term reassurance to allies and partners, which DOD officials said included Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, among other countries. These short-duration deployments were intermittent and focused on demonstrating U.S. commitment to allies and partners. Additionally, the Air Force deployed air units on 4- month rotations to help protect allies\u2019 and partners\u2019 air space. In the fiscal year 2017 budget justification materials provided to Congress, as ERI\u2019s objectives expanded, DOD requested funding to retain Air Force fighter units in Europe. It also began deploying a rotational armored brigade combat team so that one such brigade would be present in Europe at all times (see figure 2). The first deployment, in January 2017, included approximately 4,000 personnel, 90 Abrams tanks, 90 Bradley Infantry fighting vehicles, and 112 supporting vehicles. Additionally, DOD began procuring and prepositioning equipment for two planned armored brigades in Europe, one of which will include modernized tanks, as an additional deterrent. According to Army officials, these force enhancements in Europe give the Army the ability to quickly deploy a substantial ground force in the event of a conflict. As of April 2017, DOD was still evaluating force enhancements in Europe as part of its fiscal year 2018 budget submission. Specific details were omitted because they are classified. New locations and improvements to infrastructure: Since ERI was announced in 2014, DOD has established new enduring locations in Europe. An enduring location is designated by DOD and is a geographic site that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future. During our review, DOD had not yet determined whether additional enduring locations would be needed to support ERI. In addition to establishing new enduring locations, DOD plans to improve installations and infrastructure. From fiscal years 2015 through 2017, DOD requested funding in its budget justification submissions to Congress for major military construction projects in nine European countries and to improve support infrastructure\u2014such as roads, railheads, and airbasing\u2014at these locations. Major military construction projects are those projects specified in National Defense Authorization Acts. During the time of our review, DOD was considering addition improvements to existing infrastructure, specific details of which are classified. According to DOD and State Department officials, DOD is also working with U.S. allies and partners to determine what infrastructure improvements to roads, railroads, and bridges need to occur outside enduring locations to allow rapid response to a conflict. New host nation agreements: Since ERI was announced, DOD and the State Department have completed host nation agreements with six European nations in support of ERI efforts: Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, implementing previous agreements, in order to facilitate U.S. construction on installations and areas in the host country (June and July 2015 and June 2016). Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, providing an overarching framework for protections for U.S. personnel and U.S. access to installations in host nations (January 2017). DOD is using a separate process instead of its established posture planning process to plan for ERI\u2019s posture initiatives because of the emergent nature of ERI requirements and their having been funded through the OCO budget. DOD has established global defense posture management and base budget development processes that plan for posture initiatives and collectively support the department\u2019s efforts to establish priorities, evaluate resource requirements, and develop strategy and policy. As a result of its not using its established processes, DOD is not prioritizing posture initiatives funded under ERI against posture initiatives funded through its base budget, estimating these initiatives\u2019 long-term sustainment costs, or communicating their future costs to Congress. DOD is planning ERI posture initiatives outside of its established processes and is funding these enduring initiatives\u2014including rotational deployments and infrastructure projects\u2014out of its OCO budget. We have previously identified risks associated with DOD\u2019s practice of completing construction projects outside of its established processes. For example, in September 2016 we reported that DOD had not issued implementing guidance to establish a formal process for reevaluating ongoing contingency construction projects when missions change and that as a result DOD risked completing unnecessary construction projects. We also found that DOD lacked visibility into the amount of funding it was spending on operations and maintenance-funded construction projects in U.S. Central Command and that this increased financial risk and duplication risk for the department. Like U.S. Central Command, EUCOM is using DOD\u2019s OCO budget to fund construction projects and is planning those projects outside of its established processes. Based on our analysis, DOD plans to spend approximately $503 million from fiscal year 2015 through the end of fiscal year 2017 on ERI-related construction projects\u2014about $279 million for major military construction projects and $224 million for minor military construction and facilities maintenance and repair projects (hereafter, minor construction and repair), as shown in table 2. DOD has established global defense posture management and base budget development processes that plan for posture initiatives and collectively support the department\u2019s efforts to establish priorities, evaluate resource requirements, and develop strategy and policy. According to DOD Instruction 3000.12, DOD\u2019s global defense posture processes apply to DOD forces, footprint, and agreements that support joint and combined global operations and plans in foreign countries. According to the instruction, DOD\u2019s components use these processes to address planning for global defense posture, resource requirements, and policy development, among other things. Further, it states that these processes are overseen by an executive council that provides recommendations, inputs, and expertise on global defense posture to key national strategy products. DOD\u2019s Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process serves as the annual resource allocation process for DOD and is intended to enable DOD to align resources to prioritized capabilities; balance necessary warfighting capabilities with risk, affordability, and effectiveness; and provide mechanisms for making and implementing fiscally sound decisions in support of the national security strategy and the national defense strategy. DOD is using a separate and evolving process to plan ERI\u2019s posture initiatives\u2014rather than following its established processes\u2014because ERI is being funded through DOD\u2019s OCO budget. According to officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, the department has recognized that the short-term planning process used to develop DOD\u2019s OCO budget can create problems when it is used to plan for enduring initiatives. As a result, DOD has developed a separate process to plan for ERI. As part of the fiscal year 2018 planning process, EUCOM provided a prioritized list of potential requirements and an estimate of its annual costs by appropriation account to the Director for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. According to officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, DOD completed its review and provided recommendations to DOD\u2019s senior leaders for approval in October 2016 and final decisions were made within DOD in April 2017. The specific criteria by which DOD assessed EUCOM\u2019s potential requirements are classified. DOD is requesting funds for ERI\u2019s posture initiatives as part of its OCO budget, which is generally intended to be short-term funding for ongoing contingency operations. In February 2009, the Office of Management and Budget, in collaboration with DOD, issued criteria to assist in determining whether funding properly belonged in DOD\u2019s base budget or in its OCO budget. These criteria were updated in September 2010 and currently indicate that funding requests should be for specific geographic areas where combat or direct combat support operations occur (such as Iraq and Afghanistan). Further, budget items must meet other criteria. For example, OCO funding requests may be for constructing facilities and infrastructure in the theater of operations in direct support of combat operations. In these cases, the level of construction should be the minimum needed to meet operational requirements, and construction completed at enduring locations must be tied to surge operations or major changes in operational requirements. In January 2017, we reported that DOD did not apply the OCO criteria to ERI prior to deciding to budget for its requirements using its OCO budget. We recommended that DOD, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, reevaluate and revise the criteria for determining what can be included in OCO budget requests. DOD concurred with our recommendation and noted that it plans to propose revised OCO criteria. As of May 2017, the department has not implemented our recommendation. DOD\u2019s planning for ERI\u2019s posture initiatives does not establish priorities for ERI initiatives relative to those in the base budget, estimate long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, or communicate future ERI costs to Congress. When planning ERI\u2019s posture initiatives, DOD establishes priorities among ERI\u2019s initiatives but does not review posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those funded in the military services\u2019 base budgets. DOD\u2019s posture management process is intended to establish priorities among global posture elements and is overseen by a Global Posture Executive Council. According to DOD Instruction 3000.12, the Executive Council is responsible for reviewing, prioritizing, and endorsing across the combatant commands key posture elements such as military construction projects and international agreements. The Executive Council\u2019s endorsements inform the military services\u2019 budget deliberations. For the fiscal year 2017 ERI budget, EUCOM requested funding for several posture initiatives, including the continuous, rotational deployment of an armored brigade combat team and the establishment of prepositioned equipment in Europe. Officials representing the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation said that as part of its planning process for ERI the Deputy\u2019s Management Action Group evaluated and prioritized posture initiatives funded under ERI. However, DOD could not provide documentation that it had established priorities relative to posture initiatives funded through the base budget. Further, the Global Posture Executive Council did not review or prioritize posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to posture initiatives funded through DOD\u2019s base budget. Similarly, as DOD prepared the fiscal year 2018 ERI budget request, the Global Posture Executive Council did not prioritize EUCOM\u2019s proposed ERI posture initiatives relative to initiatives funded through DOD\u2019s base budget. More detailed information about these proposals, and their potential funding requirements, are classified. According to officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Joint Staff, DOD did not prioritize posture initiatives funded under ERI against base-budget funded posture initiatives, because ERI is funded through DOD\u2019s OCO budget\u2014which does not directly affect the services\u2019 base budgets. However, because it does not prioritize ERI initiatives against other initiatives funded through the base budget, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of initiatives funded under ERI and may begin investing in projects that it would not support in the absence of funding from DOD\u2019s OCO budget. For example, Army officials noted that if funding were to become unavailable in DOD\u2019s OCO budget, the Army is unsure how initiatives funded under ERI would rank in importance relative to other posture initiatives funded in its base budget. Consequently, the Army would be forced to make critical\u2014and potentially costly\u2014decisions quickly and without a clear idea of which posture initiatives were most important to the department. In planning for posture initiatives funded under ERI, EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term sustainment costs of ERI\u2019s posture initiatives to establish prepositioned equipment and construct new facilities. DOD\u2019s global defense posture guidance indicates that, when evaluating potential changes to posture, the combatant commands should work with the military services to estimate the full cost of planned posture initiatives, including sustainment costs. DOD\u2019s guidance on economic analysis also notes the importance of understanding both the size and timing of costs. Finally, our prior work has demonstrated that comprehensive cost estimates of current and future resource requirements are critical to making funding decisions and assessing program affordability. DOD leadership emphasized throughout the fiscal year 2018 budget review process that the services would need to fund ERI posture sustainment costs through their respective base budgets, but DOD did not direct the services and EUCOM to estimate these costs as they would have under their established processes. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation said that DOD leadership emphasized that the military services would need to fund all future sustainment costs for ERI projects from their base budgets. Based on DOD\u2019s approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, we determined that ERI sustainment costs for prepositioned equipment and construction could be substantial. Army and Air Force officials said that they were working to identify and incorporate these costs into future base budget submissions. DOD officials said that we correctly applied DOD\u2019s approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower than the estimated costs, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. Additionally, officials said that EUCOM is trying to negotiate burden sharing agreements with host nations; however, it is unclear whether these negotiations will be successful or how any resulting agreements would affect DOD\u2019s future costs. Without comprehensive estimates of the sustainment costs for the prepositioned equipment and major military construction projects in Europe, DOD decision makers have been limited in their ability to evaluate the affordability of these initiatives. Further, in the absence of these estimates, the services have been limited in their ability to plan for costs in future budgets, because they have an incomplete understanding of the magnitude of those costs and of when they are likely to be incurred. The funding plan that DOD submits to Congress for ERI does not contain information about ERI\u2019s future costs. This is in contrast to the way DOD submits its funding plan for its base budget, where DOD provides Congress with cost projections over a 5-year period, by appropriation, leaving Congress with a better understanding of how and when to allocate resources. In reviewing the fiscal year 2018 ERI request, the Director for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation assessed future costs associated with posture initiatives funded under ERI. We previously reported that DOD was not developing enduring requirements funded through its OCO budget as part of its budget and programming process. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation told us that DOD has not been required to provide estimates for future OCO costs for ERI to Congress previously. An official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) told us that DOD does not plan to provide these future costs to Congress along with its fiscal year 2018 ERI budget submission. Additionally, in preparing its posture requirements, EUCOM did not identify assumptions regarding host nation and NATO burden sharing. For example, officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy said that DOD has submitted a request to the NATO Security Investment Programm\u00e9 for $200 million in funding to build a facility in Poland to store Army equipment. Officials told us that, as a result, this construction project was identified as a lesser priority in EUCOM\u2019s fiscal year 2018 request for funding. A senior Army officer told us that completion of a facility in Poland was critical to its plans in Europe. Officials from the U.S. Mission to NATO told us that as of July 2016 NATO had approved funding to complete preliminary architectural and engineering design for this project. Officials expect additional funding will be made available in July 2017 to complete final design and site preparation and the full cost of the project will be approved in early 2019. However, these officials noted that additional funding beyond what has been approved by NATO may be required to meet U.S.-specific requirements. Similarly, EUCOM officials said that they are working to identify opportunities to defray future costs through host nation contributions, but it is unclear how much funding\u2014if any\u2014host nations will provide moving forward. Congress has expressed interest in knowing the future costs of enduring activities being funded through DOD\u2019s OCO budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee\u2019s report accompanying a bill for DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2015 appropriations stated that the committee does not have an understanding of enduring activities funded by the OCO budget. The committee further noted that there is a potential for risk in continuing to fund non-contingency-related activities through the OCO budget. Both GAO\u2019s and other federal standards emphasize that agencies should provide complete and reliable information on the costs of programs externally, so that decision makers can make informed decisions when allocating resources. DOD has not provided Congress projections of future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI because it is reviewing those requirements outside of its budget and programming processes, and DOD officials said that the department is not required to provide this information. As a result, DOD is limiting congressional visibility into the resources needed to achieve ERI\u2019s objectives. If DOD does not provide Congress with projections of the future costs of posture initiatives funded under ERI and information on its assumptions pertaining to host nation support and burden sharing, it will continue to impede congressional visibility into the resources that are needed to fully implement these initiatives. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the subsequent threat of further aggression led DOD to establish and later expand ERI\u2019s objectives and enhance posture in Europe to support a new U.S. strategy toward Russia. DOD has requested funding for these enhancements using its OCO budget; however, the processes DOD uses to develop its OCO budget were not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives such as ERI. By following a separate planning process when funding ERI with OCO, DOD is taking on risk by not reviewing and prioritizing ERI posture plans against other posture initiatives, estimating the costs for sustaining ERI initiatives, and providing Congress with estimates of ERI\u2019s future costs. DOD risks making decisions that lack a strategic vision in comparison to other DOD priorities and may fund initiatives that cannot be sustained over the long term. Furthermore, Congress is likely to face challenges in assessing DOD\u2019s estimated costs for ERI and the affordability of initiatives funded under ERI over the long term. To better ensure that DOD can target resources to its most critical initiatives and establish priorities across its base budget and overseas contingency operations budget, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in its base budget as part of its established posture-planning processes. (Recommendation 1) To better enable decision makers to evaluate the full long-term costs of posture initiatives under ERI, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct EUCOM and the military services to develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure projects under ERI and ensure that the services plan for these long-term costs in future budgets. (Recommendation 2) To support congressional decision making, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense provide to Congress, along with the department\u2019s annual budget submission, estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and other enduring costs that include assumptions such as those pertaining to the level of host nation support and burden sharing. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of the classified report to DOD for review and comment. DOD partially concurred with all three of our recommendations, and we have reproduced DOD\u2019s comments on the classified report in appendix II. DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation to use its established posture-planning processes to prioritize ERI\u2019s posture initiatives relative to those funded in DOD\u2019s base budget. In its comments, DOD stated that it will continue to prioritize the negotiation of international agreements supporting ERI through the Global Posture Executive Council, and that an on-going Strategic Review will inform ERI and guide both EUCOM and the services in their program planning efforts. These are positive steps. DOD also stated it will adjudicate its ERI-funded force requirements through its global force management process, adding that it will continue to resource OCO funds for ERI requirements until there is a sufficient increase in DOD\u2019s base budget to do so. However, we continue to believe, as noted in our report, that DOD could improve its planning for posture initiatives funded under ERI, whether or not they are funded through OCO, by using DOD\u2019s established posture planning processes. Although DOD\u2019s global force management process directly affects overseas military posture in the near term, this process is not designed to evaluate long-term posture priorities. If DOD does not prioritize the forces and infrastructure projects funded under ERI against those funded using the military services\u2019 base budgets, it will continue to lack an understanding of the relative importance of the posture initiatives funded under ERI. Without such an understanding, DOD increases the risk that the services will need to make critical and potentially costly decisions without a clear idea of which posture initiatives are most critical to the department. DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that EUCOM and the military services develop estimates for future sustainment costs and plan for these costs in future budgets. In its comments, DOD stated that its components will continue to estimate the sustainment costs for prepositioned stocks and other infrastructure projects during DOD\u2019s annual program and budget review process. DOD also commented that without additional topline base budget funding, some portion of the associated sustainment costs will need to be financed with OCO funds. However, as we noted in our report, neither the Army nor the Air Force has fully estimated these potentially significant future costs, nor had either service incorporated them into their future budgets. Using OCO funds would mark a departure from DOD leadership\u2019s emphasis that the services would need to fund ERI posture sustainment costs through their respective base budgets. Additionally, not developing robust estimates for sustaining these initiatives could increase long-term fiscal risk for the department if DOD shifts more ERI-associated enduring costs into its OCO budget. In the absence of robust cost estimates and deliberate planning to address those costs in future budgets, DOD will continue to be limited in its ability to evaluate the affordability of posture initiatives funded under ERI, and the military services may not plan adequate funding to sustain posture investments in Europe. DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation, to provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and information on any underlying assumptions, such as those pertaining to the level of host nation support and burden sharing. In its comments, DOD stated that it does not currently prepare a formal 5-year Future Years Defense Program for OCO-related costs. Moreover, DOD commented that it factors in host nation support and burden sharing when preparing budget estimates for Congress. However, DOD does not state whether it will begin to provide Congress future estimates and any underlying assumptions with its budget submission. It is critical that DOD increase congressional visibility into ERI\u2019s future costs and its underlying assumptions to facilitate congressional oversight and reasonably ensure that initiatives can be sustained over the long-term.

GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in Appendix III. The Army and Air Force identified approximately $224 million in unspecified minor military construction and facilities maintenance and repair projects (hereafter, minor construction and repair) that were programmed or obligated for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) in fiscal years 2015 through 2017. This includes $157 million for minor construction and repair projects identified by the Army and nearly $67 million for minor construction and repair projects identified by the Air Force. According to U.S. European Command officials, Navy and Marine Corps construction projects funded under ERI were either major military construction or exercise-related construction projects. The tables below do not include Navy and Marine Corps exercise-related construction projects. Using the data provided by the military services, we compiled the programmed and obligated funding for these minor construction and repair projects by fiscal year, country, location, and project name in tables 3 and 4. The information in these tables was provided by U.S. Army Europe and U.S. Air Force Europe in response to our request for a list of minor military construction and repair projects. The data provided did not identify the appropriations used for each project. Accordingly, we have not conducted a review to examine whether funds were appropriately used for a given project.

                "In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendations. GAO continues to believe that these recommendations are warranted."

            "context": "With a staff of over 47,000 members, the Coast Guard operates a multimission fleet of 201 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft and over 1,400 boats and ships. Operational control of surface and air assets is divided into two geographic Areas (Pacific and Atlantic), within which are nine Districts consisting of 37 sectors and the stations within them. The Coast Guard\u2019s program oversight, policy development, and personnel administration are carried out at the Coast Guard\u2019s headquarters. As shown in table 1, the Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions identified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended. The Coast Guard manages these missions through six mission programs, also listed in table 1. As part of its marine safety mission, for example, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations, including those involving commercial fishing vessels, which are part of an industry with one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States. For each of its 11 missions, the Coast Guard has developed goals and targets to assess and communicate agency performance. The Coast Guard\u2019s performance assessment process also includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. As part of its process, the Coast Guard is to establish targets for the current and subsequent 2 fiscal years, according to Coast Guard officials. Each target is set by the Coast Guard, but according to the Coast Guard\u2019s Annual Performance Report (APR), some are derived from external factors. For example, DHS requires that Coast Guard set a 100 percent target for the percent of people in imminent danger saved in the maritime environment. Further, several of the Coast Guard\u2019s assets used to conduct these missions are approaching the end of their intended service lives. As part of its efforts to modernize its assets used to carry out various missions, the Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels, such as the National Security Cutter, the Fast Response Cutter as well as other assets. However, concerns surrounding the affordability of this effort remain as the Coast Guard continues to pursue multiple new acquisitions without long-term planning to guide the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. Figure 1 shows the Coast Guard\u2019s Fast Response Cutter and National Security Cutter. We previously reported on actions the Coast Guard could take to ensure that, among other things, it addresses limitations posed by incomplete data, the use of unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations with its performance goal data, for more effective program management. Examples of data limitations that we have recommended that the Coast Guard take action on are below. Improve completeness of mission data. In December 2017, we found that several different federal agencies play a role in overseeing and promoting commercial fishing vessel safety, including the Coast Guard. As part of its marine safety activities, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations. Commercial fishing has one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States and vessel disasters are the leading cause of fatalities among fishers, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. However, our December 2017 review found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard\u2019s knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard collects some data on commercial fishing vessels that operate in federal waters\u2014including a vessel\u2019s length and construction date\u2014but data on the population of the active U.S. commercial fishing vessel fleet are not complete. Between 2006 and 2015, the Coast Guard investigated 2,101 commercial fishing vessel accidents that were identified as occurring in federal waters. While the number of accidents generally increased over this time period, the number of injuries and fatalities declined over the same 10-year period. However, we could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery\u2014 meaning the area in which a certain type of fish (e.g., shrimp, salmon, crab) is caught\u2014because the Coast Guard\u2019s data is not complete. Further, we were unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities, because reliable data on certain information needed to do so\u2014including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates\u2014are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Having this information could be useful to carrying out the Coast Guard\u2019s marine safety mission, which includes enforcing laws to prevent death, injury and property loss in the marine environment. We recommended in our December 2017 report that the Coast Guard ensure that data it collects during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. We also recommended that the Coast Guard work with stakeholders to form a working group to determine an efficient means to establish a reliable estimate of the population of active commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard agreed with both recommendations, and in February 2018 informed us that it is in the process of developing additional data fields to capture more information, such as the fishery in which the commercial fishing is involved, and is engaging stakeholders to establish an appropriate working group. We will continue to monitor these actions. Use more realistic asset performance data. In our May 2016 report on Coast Guard strategic planning, we found that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission. We reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s strategic allocations of assets were based on unrealistic assumptions about the performance capacity of its assets and did not reflect asset condition and unscheduled maintenance. This was due, in part, to the Coast Guard not including information from its field units on the actual performance of its assets. For example, agency officials noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old and these cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring emergency dry dock repairs, which resulted in reduced availability to carry out their missions during the year. In another example, a field unit stated that based on historical use, it planned for 575 hours per vessel for one type of cutter instead of the 825 hours performance capacity. Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard\u2019s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the headquarters\u2019 strategic intent, which is based on asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address related risks. We recommended that the Coast Guard incorporate field unit input, such as information on assets\u2019 actual performance, to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation, and in February 2018 informed us that it plans to address this recommendation through changes to two process documents that are under revision, with an expected completion date in March 2018. Improve performance goal data. In our October 2017 review of Coast Guard performance goals, we reported that the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with two of the seven selected performance goals we reviewed, including the five year average number of recreational boating deaths and injuries. In particular, officials believe that many recreational boating injuries that do not require hospitalization are not reported to the Coast Guard. These officials believe that the amount of underreporting may vary over time due to changes in industry trends, making it difficult to accurately determine actual injury rates and program performance. We determined that the data for this performance goal was not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives due to these likely limitations. We found that the Coast Guard did not report the possible extent of these limitations with this performance goal in its fiscal year 2016 APR. For the other performance goal, the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with the number of detected incursions of foreign fishing vessels violating U.S. waters, which is publicly reported in DHS\u2019s APR. DHS\u2019s review of this performance goal, reported in August 2015, raised questions about the validity of this goal\u2014that is, whether it provides a useful measure of the Coast Guard\u2019s performance. Specifically, the review noted that this performance goal is intended to measure a deterrence effect, but doing so is inherently difficult and may lead to contradictory interpretations of performance. In October 2017, we found that the data for this performance goal was sufficiently reliable for our reporting objective purposes, but questions remain about its validity. Reliable data is not a useful indication of performance unless it is also a valid representation of the goal being addressed. DHS officials reported that they did not include a discussion of the limitations for this performance goal in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2015 APR because the performance goal met the minimum threshold for data reliability despite the goal\u2019s limitations. Coast Guard officials reported they were aware of these limitations and were working with DHS and OMB to improve the performance goal and implement corrective actions within 1 to 2 years. We recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents, as needed, based on the results of the assessment. The Coast Guard concurred and in February 2018, informed us that it had taken initial actions to address our recommendation. However, our preliminary review of these actions indicates that further action will be needed to fully address our recommendation, such as documenting and reporting the limitations of performance data. Our previous reports have identified areas in which the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of its data used for reporting on its mission performance and planning. Improve transparency of data on mission performance. In our October 2017 report on performance goals, we found that the Coast Guard\u2019s APR has not been released publicly since 2011 due to a previous DHS leadership decision. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard\u2019s missions. For example, one of the Coast Guard\u2019s missions\u2014defense readiness\u2014has no goals that are publicly reported or shared with Congress, even though measures related to defense readiness are included in the Coast Guard\u2019s APR. Coast Guard officials stated that they could see the benefit of publicly releasing their APR; however, DHS\u2019s decision to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly has so far deterred the Coast Guard from pursuing the public release of its APR. DHS officials told us that the department is concerned about conflicting information that a component\u2019s APR might present because it is vetted and produced separately from the DHS APR. However, the lack of transparency regarding performance data shared publicly and with Congress can result in an incomplete picture of mission performance and can limit effective oversight of Coast Guard operations. As a result, the public and Congress may be unable to determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is meeting its missions. We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard\u2019s public website. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation and in February 2018, the Coast Guard informed us that it had completed its 2017 APR and are determining an appropriate approach for making it publicly available. Improve capital planning transparency. In our previously issued work on the Coast Guard\u2019s annual 5-year capital investment plan (CIP), we found that the CIP does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs that are made as part of the annual budget cycle. We made several recommendations in recent years intended to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult tradeoff decisions it will likely face. The Coast Guard generally concurred with these recommendations and is in various stages of implementation. For example, in 2017 we reported that we have made recommendations that DHS and the Coast Guard take several actions to gain an understanding of what the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission within its likely acquisition funding levels. These recommended actions included the Coast Guard: (1) conducting a comprehensive portfolio review across all its acquisitions to develop revised baselines that meet mission needs and reflect realistic funding scenarios and (2) developing a 20-year plan that identifies all necessary recapitalization efforts and any fiscal resources likely necessary to complete these efforts. For example, in 2014 we recommended the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources needed to acquire them. Without these efforts, the Coast Guard will continue, as it has in recent years, to plan its future acquisitions through the annual budgeting process, an approach that has led to delayed and reduced capabilities. In 2016, the Coast Guard revised its 2005 Mission Needs Statement, which provides a basic foundation for long-term investment planning that is to serve as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of various fleet mixes, and inform the Coast Guard\u2019s CIP. However, the 2016 Mission Needs Statement did not identify specific assets the Coast Guard needs to achieve its missions, nor did it update the annual hours it needs from each asset class to satisfactorily complete its missions. The Coast Guard has stated it is developing a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition Plan, but it has not stated when the plan will be completed or what will be included in this plan, such as potential trade-offs that could be made across the Coast Guard\u2019s portfolio of acquisitions to better meet mission needs within realistic funding levels. A long-term plan with a tradeoff analysis would facilitate a full understanding of the affordability challenges facing the Coast Guard while it builds the Offshore Patrol Cutter. DHS concurred with our 2014 recommendation, but it is unclear when the Coast Guard plans to complete the 20-year plan. Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and members of the sub- committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have at this time.

                "The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data. DHS and the Coast Guard agreed with these recommendations and reported actions or plans to address them."

            "context": "CAPTA, originally enacted in 1974, provides formula grants to states to improve child protective service systems. ACF administers the CAPTA state grant program and provides guidance and oversight to states. In fiscal year 2017, Congress provided about $25 million for the program. As part of the CAPTA state grant program, states are required to submit to the Secretary of HHS plans outlining how they intend to use CAPTA funds to improve their child protective service systems, among other things. State plans remain in effect for the duration of states\u2019 participation in the grant program; if modifications are needed, these must be submitted. In addition to state plans, states are required to submit to HHS an annual data report providing information on agency decisions made in response to referrals of child abuse and neglect, as well as preventive services provided to families, among other things. CAPTA requires state governors to provide a series of assurances in their state plans. Since 2003, governors have had to provide an assurance that states have in effect and are enforcing a state law or program that includes policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or displaying withdrawal symptoms at birth. Under states\u2019 policies and procedures, health care providers are required to notify CPS of such infants. Governors must also assure that a plan of safe care is developed for these infants. Although CAPTA does not define \u201cplans of safe care,\u201d for the purposes of this report we define them as plans to ensure the safety and well-being of infants who are born substance-affected. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) amended certain provisions of CAPTA that relate to substance-affected infants (see table 1). In addition to provisions related to substance-affected infants, CAPTA also requires governors to provide an assurance to the Secretary of HHS that they have provisions or procedures for certain individuals to report known and suspected instances of child abuse and neglect, which are generally referred to as mandated reporter laws. All states have statutes identifying persons who are required to report suspected child maltreatment to an appropriate agency, such as child protective services, a law enforcement agency, or a state\u2019s toll-free child abuse reporting hotline, according to a 2016 HHS report. Mandatory reporters often include social workers; teachers, principals, and other school personnel; physicians, nurses, and other health care workers; and counselors, therapists, and other mental health professionals. The circumstances under which a mandatory reporter must make a report vary from state to state, according to HHS. Typically, a report must be made when the reporter, in his or her official capacity, suspects or has reason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected. State laws require mandatory reporters to report the facts and circumstances that led them to suspect that a child has been abused or neglected; they do not have the burden of providing proof that abuse or neglect has occurred. CPS, a division within state and local social services, is generally the agency that conducts an initial assessment or investigation of reports of child abuse and neglect. It also offers services to families and children where maltreatment has occurred or is likely to occur. Typically, when CPS agencies receive a notification about suspected child abuse, including a substance-affected infant, social workers review the referral to determine if it should be accepted for investigation. During an investigation, social workers determine, among other things, the nature, extent, and cause of abuse or neglect, and identify the person responsible for the maltreatment. An investigation may include the following: a visit to the hospital and/or infant\u2019s home; observation of the infant; risk and safety assessments; evaluation of the home environment; background checks, including criminal record checks of adults that reside with the family; as well as mental health evaluations. If social workers determine that there is enough evidence to suggest that an infant is at risk for harm or neglect, or that abuse or neglect occurred, the case is substantiated. Once a case is substantiated, CPS develops a case plan with the family outlining objectives and tasks for the family. Among other things, CPS may refer the family to services in the community, such as early intervention services, parenting classes, and substance abuse treatment. Generally, CPS attempts to strengthen the family and alleviate the problems which led to maltreatment. If the case is not substantiated, but there is genuine concern about the child\u2019s situation and the family may benefit from services in the community, the case may be closed and/or the family may be referred for voluntary services (see figure 1). Prenatal maternal opioid use has increased considerably in recent years. This increase has contributed to a significant rise in the rate of NAS. According to a recent study, the rate of NAS has increased from 1.2 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 5.8 per 1,000 hospital births in 2012, reaching a total of 21,732 infants diagnosed with NAS. NAS occurs with considerable variability. According to a recent HHS report, various studies indicate that anywhere from 55 to 94 percent of infants exposed to opioids in-utero exhibit some degree of symptoms. Typically, infants with NAS develop symptoms within 72 hours of birth, but may develop symptoms within the first 2 weeks of life, including after hospital discharge. For the purpose of this report, infants exposed to opioids ingested by mothers in utero are considered substance-exposed, and those born negatively affected by exposure or experiencing withdrawal symptoms are considered substance-affected. According to experts, NAS is considered an expected and treatable result of women\u2019s prenatal opioid use. Opioid exposure during pregnancy may occur for the following reasons: Women receiving pain medication with a prescription under the care of a physician. Medications can include fentanyl and oxycodone. Women under the care of a physician and undergoing treatment for an opioid use disorder with medications, such as methadone or buprenorphine. This type of treatment is generally referred to as medication-assisted treatment (MAT). Women misusing opioid pain medications with or without a prescription (such as using without a prescription, using a different dosage than prescribed, or continuing to use a drug when no longer needed for pain). Women using or abusing illicit opioid, such as heroin. In response to our survey, 42 states reported that state policies and procedures require health care providers to notify CPS about substance- affected infants. Some states reported that they explicitly require health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants. For example, Wisconsin reported that under its state law if tests indicate that infants have controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in their bodily fluids, the health care provider shall report the occurrence of that condition to CPS. Others reported that the requirement is met by their states\u2019 mandated reporter law\u2014whereby people in certain positions, including health care providers, are required to notify CPS about substance-affected infants, similar to the manner in which other mandatory reporters, like school teachers, day care personnel, and social workers are required to report other instances of child abuse and neglect. For example, Kentucky statute requires that \u201cany person who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a child is dependent, neglected, or abused shall immediately\u201d make a report to the police or CPS. The statutory definition for an abused or neglected child in Kentucky includes situations where a child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or threatened with harm because of parental incapacity due to alcohol and other drug abuse. Of the 42 states that require health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants, 21 reported that notification is required for infants affected by both illegal and legal use of opioids. For example, in Massachusetts health care providers are required to notify CPS orally and, in writing within 48 hours, about substance-affected infants physically dependent on drugs, even if the drugs were legally obtained and the mother is under the care of a prescribing medical professional. Sixteen of the 42 states reported that health care providers are required to notify CPS of infants affected only by the illegal use of opioids, and five of the 42 states reported that they did not know if health care providers were required to notify CPS of infants affected by the illegal and legal use of opioids. The other eight states reported that although they did not have policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants, they have laws or policies that encourage notification. Specifically, in written responses to our survey: Two states reported that under their state mandated reporter laws health care providers are encouraged, but not required, to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. Four states reported that they are working to amend their states\u2019 policies and procedures to require that health care providers refer substance-affected infants to CPS. Another state reported that it encourages the notification from health care providers, but has not sought legislation to require health care providers to report substance-affected infants to CPS because of concerns that any laws that criminalize prenatal substance use would further deter substance-using pregnant women from seeking prenatal care. The state\u2019s law requires all hospital personnel who suspect abuse and neglect or observe conditions that are likely to result in abuse or neglect to notify CPS. One state reported that all persons, including health care providers, are required to report child abuse and neglect, but reporting depends on whether a hospital\u2019s policy indicates substance abuse is child abuse or neglect. Further, the state CPS director reported collaboration with the health care community on reporting substance exposed infants to its child abuse hotline. Although one state reported in our survey that it does not require or encourage health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants, in an interview, state officials explained that its policy requires that health care providers notify CPS if, through an assessment, they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse and neglect. Under the state\u2019s law, health care providers in each county are required to assess the needs of mothers and substance-affected infants using a protocol established by county health departments, CPS agencies, and hospitals. State officials told us that under the state\u2019s law, the birth of a substance- affected infant is not in and of itself a sufficient basis for reporting child abuse or neglect. In addition to having policies and procedures regarding the reporting of substance-affected infants, in written responses to our survey some states reported providing training and guidance to support the efforts of health care providers to notify CPS about these infants. Three states reported that they offer mandatory reporter training to inform health care providers that they are obligated to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. Another state reported that its Department of Human Services developed a guide for mandated reporters that discusses what needs to be reported and where to make reports. Also, one state reported that it sent a formal letter to its state hospital association about how to report substance-affected infants to CPS. This state also sent a memo to its CPS county directors instructing them to contact their local health care providers on the importance of reporting substance-affected infants to CPS and the process for doing so. In addition, during our Massachusetts site visit, officials shared with us a memo that was sent to mandated reporters, community partners, and other stakeholders that offered guidance on when to file a report about substance-exposed infants. Further, local CPS staff at one Massachusetts field office told us that upon request they provide mandated reporter training to health care providers. Despite these policies, procedures, and guidance, in written responses to our survey, a few states reported concerns about requiring health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and the definition of substance-affected. All of the hospitals that we visited have policies consistent with their state\u2019s law that require that health care providers, primarily hospital social workers, to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. However, one state reported that some medical personnel have been reluctant to report some infants that are positive for illegal and legal substances due to fears of mothers being arrested. Another state reported that stakeholders are concerned that having to notify CPS about substance-affected infants will have a chilling effect on the willingness of pregnant women who use substances to be honest with providers and seek the help and support they need and deserve. According to one state, there is often an inherent resistance to contacting CPS in these cases as health care providers tend to view child welfare involvement as punitive rather than a potential resource for the family. In addition, three states reported in written responses to our survey challenges understanding how to define terms, such as substance- affected, under CAPTA. For example, the Pennsylvania CPS director expressed concerns during our site visit, suggesting that CAPTA raises many unanswered questions, such as (1) if \u201caffected by substances\u201d means at-risk of being or physically affected by substances, (2) what policies relating to substance-affected infants should look like and include, and (3) whether \u201caffected by substances\u201d should include women who are under the care of health care or treatment providers and taking their medications as prescribed. A Kentucky public health official told us that a drug test, or whether the infant is affected by legal or illegal substances, should not be the sole factor in determining CPS\u2019 involvement with a family. Rather, a holistic view of the family, whether the substance prohibits the mother\u2019s ability to care for her child, and any risk factors present that places the infant at risk should also be considered. According to officials, an infant that is exposed to substances, but has not been affected by the substance, can still be at risk for child abuse and neglect. In response to our survey, 46 states reported that they have policies and procedures for deciding which notifications about substance-affected infants are accepted for investigation. Seventeen of those states reported that all notifications of substance-affected infants are accepted for investigation, regardless of the circumstances. The remaining 29 states reported that they apply specific criteria to determine if children who present as substance-affected are accepted for investigation by CPS. Several states reported in written responses to our survey that they base their criteria for accepting notifications on the infant\u2019s safety. For these states, drug exposure does not by itself indicate that an infant\u2019s safety is at risk. For example, one state explained that in determining a child\u2019s safety risk, staff evaluate a number of factors including the history of the family; the family\u2019s presentation at the birthing hospital (appearance of chaotic behavior, suspected intoxication of adults, lack of appropriate concern or bonding with the infant); the presentation of the infant\u2019s physical condition; the results of any testing of parent or child (blood, urine, etc.); discrepancies identified in the parent\u2019s representation of their substance use or substance use treatment; and any other concerns noted by the reporting source. Other states reported that their criteria for accepting notifications for investigation are based on the degree or type of drug exposure in question. For example, one state reported that its policy directs CPS agencies to accept notifications for investigation when a parent has used illegal substances or non-medical use of prescribed medication during the last trimester of pregnancy. Another state reported that it will accept notifications for investigation if the infant is born with a positive toxicology or is experiencing drug withdrawal, or if the mother tests positive for substances. A few states reported using both risk to the safety of infants as well as degree or type of drug as their criteria for accepting notifications. For example, one state reported that it considers factors, such as the type of drug, the parent\u2019s ability to care for the child, addiction history, and the parent\u2019s readiness and preparation to care for the infant. In follow-up correspondences with states that reported that they do not have policies and procedures to decide whether to accept for investigation notices about substance-affected infants, one state reported that decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. A few states reported that after receiving notifications about substance- affected infants, CPS agencies may decide to opt out of investigating some families, referred to as \u201cscreening out\u201d families. For example, in Massachusetts, CPS can \u201cscreen out\u201d referrals of mothers if the only substance affecting the infants was used by the mothers as prescribed by their physician. In these instances, when CPS in Massachusetts is notified by the hospital about an infant, the screener gathers information from the caller and consults with a supervisor to determine whether the referral should be accepted for investigation or screened out. If the mother is on methadone, for example, but is involved with services and is in a treatment plan, CPS verifies with medical or other qualified providers that the mother used the drug as part of substance abuse or medical treatment as authorized. Additionally, CPS confirms that there are no other concerns of child abuse and/or neglect. If CPS officials in Massachusetts are unable to collect all the information that they need to screen out families, for example when a mother does not sign a release allowing CPS officials to speak with her health care providers, notifications about substance-affected infants are accepted for investigation. In response to our survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan to ensure the safety and well-being of substance-affected infants who meet the state\u2019s criteria for investigation. Two states reported that CPS staff are not required to develop such a plan, even if a notification is accepted for an investigation or an assessment. For purposes of this report, we are defining a plan of safe care as a plan to ensure the safety and well-being of the infant. States\u2019 approaches to identifying children and families who will receive a plan of safe care generally fall into two categories: 38 states reported that CPS is required to develop a plan of safe care for all notifications of substance-affected infants that are accepted for investigation, including those that are not substantiated. 11 states reported that CPS staff are required to develop a plan of safe care only in those instances where an investigation substantiates the notification or uncovers an unmet need or present or emerging danger. For example, local Pennsylvania CPS officials told us that they only develop plans when there is a safety threat or other concern about the infant. Most states reported that after a notification of a substance-affected infant is accepted for investigation, CPS always conducts a needs assessment for the infant and caregivers. For example, one local CPS office that we visited told us that social workers assess risk to and safety of infants, their function (development, age appropriate behavior, etc.), and environment. In addition, workers assess the caregiver\u2019s ability to parent and employment status, as well as housing. The assessments conducted as part of the investigation inform the development of plans of safe care, as well as decisions about the removal of infants from the home. Among the 49 states that reported that plans of safe care are developed for all or some substance-affected infants, 47 reported that these plans either always or sometimes address infants\u2019 safety needs. Plans also address other needs, such as infants\u2019 immediate medical and longer-term developmental needs, as well as caregiver\u2019s substance use treatment needs. See figure 2 for the number of states whose plans of safe care address various issues facing the infant and parent. In written responses to our survey and during our site visits, officials reported that plans of safe care and referrals for services included in the plans are individualized based on the infant and family\u2019s needs. For example, Massachusetts state CPS officials told us that plans of safe care are developed for each family based on the information that staff collect from the safety, risk, and family assessments, as well as information collected from individuals who may have knowledge that would inform the family assessments, such as medical and treatment providers, and family members. Kentucky state CPS officials told us that the local organizations and service providers that they collaborate with to develop the plan of safe care also vary based on the family\u2019s needs. For example, Kentucky will only collaborate with substance use treatment providers to develop the plan of safe care when families have substance use disorders. Similarly, during our site visits, officials from two states told us that the decision to place an infant in foster care is based on the individualized needs of the infant and caregiver. For example, Massachusetts state officials told us that their decision to remove a baby from the home depends on a myriad of factors and is determined on a case-by-case basis. Officials explained that if a mother is discharged from the hospital and begins using drugs again and does not have adequate supports in place to care for her baby, CPS may decide to place the infant in foster care. However, if a mother has existing support systems in place to mitigate safety risks, CPS may decide to keep the baby in the home. In our survey, all 51 states reported that their agencies either always or sometimes refer parents or caregivers to substance use treatment programs, and most states reported that they always or sometimes refer parents or caregivers to parenting classes or programs (49), and other supportive services (49). CPS officials in each of the three states that we visited told us that their plans of safe care include referrals to address not only the immediate needs of the infants, but also the needs of the parent or caregiver. For example, officials from a local Kentucky CPS agency told us that staff refer mothers of substance-exposed infants to a program called Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Team (START). START is comprised of a social worker and a peer support mentor who has at least 3 years of sobriety, previous involvement with CPS, and was successfully able to regain or keep custody of her own children. According to officials, the START program has been able to provide participants with quick access to substance use disorder treatment. Officials from a Massachusetts local CPS agency told us that one of the services that they provide to parents of substance-affected infants is a parent aide who can help monitor how the parent is caring for the infant, such as administering the infant\u2019s medications appropriately and ensuring the parent is not abusing the infant\u2019s drugs. In addition, a parent aide can provide emotional support and help parents adjust after the infant is discharged from the hospital. Kentucky officials noted the effect that a healthy caregiver has on the outcome of the infant and emphasized that a baby cannot be healthy if the mother is not. Kentucky CPS officials said that they have found that the earlier caregivers enter treatment, the better the outcomes are for mothers and babies. According to Kentucky officials, parents who participate in the START program are less likely to have their child placed in foster care. Officials from the states that we visited told us that developing and monitoring plans of safe care under CAPTA\u2019s new requirements for infants affected by their mother\u2019s legal use of prescribed medications, as well as plans for these infants\u2019 caregivers, present challenges. Specifically, officials reported concerns about increased caseloads, particularly if they are required to provide plans and services for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect, the content of plans, and confidentiality restrictions. Thirty-one of 50 states reported on our survey that staffing or resource limitations was very or extremely challenging, and CPS officials across the 3 states we visited said that the opioid epidemic has directly contributed to increased caseloads. According to a local Kentucky CPS office, the number of babies that met criteria for being accepted for investigation has increased about 55 percent from 2011 to 2016, while the number of staff has remained the same. Similarly, hospitals reported being impacted by this challenge. For example, staff at four hospitals we visited told us that they have delayed discharging infants from the hospital because CPS social workers did not identify caregivers to whom infants may be released or make plans for infants in a timely manner. In addition, staff from three hospitals told us that some CPS workers are difficult to contact and not especially responsive to their questions. One hospital social worker told us that she is concerned that the changes to CAPTA that require notifying CPS of all substance-affected newborns will inundate the agencies with cases. Officials from two of the three states we visited anticipated that providing services to infants affected by the legal use of prescribed medications, but not likely to be at risk for child abuse and neglect, will result in an increase in the number of families referred to CPS. This, in turn, will require a plan of safe care and further strain limited resources. Twenty- five states reported in our survey that the plan they develop for substance-affected infants is the same as for other children in CPS care, suggesting that states devote the same level of resources to these infants as other cases. The states we visited interpret CAPTA to require that plans of safe care be developed for all substance-affected infants who are referred to CPS, including those who may not meet usual criteria to be accepted for an investigation. Some state officials we interviewed questioned whether the new CAPTA requirements would allow for the best use of limited resources. For example, one senior state CPS official questioned whether it would be a good use of resources to develop plans of safe care for mothers in substance use disorder treatment or mothers using opioid medications due to chronic pain. A local CPS official we interviewed stated that drug exposure, in and of itself, is not necessarily a safety risk, and CPS should not intervene with families who are not at risk for child abuse or neglect. Instead, hospitals or treatment providers should intervene and refer families who do not meet criteria for CPS involvement, but could benefit from additional supports, to voluntary services. Kentucky public health officials told us that the period after a woman gives birth is a critical time for families as mothers may be stressed, sleep-deprived, exhausted, and may have other children in the home. This period may be especially challenging for mothers with substance use disorders, if adequate supports are not in place. According to officials women are typically covered for substance use treatment during pregnancy; however, this coverage ends roughly 60 days after the baby is born. In written responses to our survey, some states reported that they would rely on other agencies to develop plans of safe care. Similarly, in order to manage limited CPS resources, officials from two of the three states that we visited said they are considering having hospitals or other agencies assume responsibility for developing plans of safe care when there is no evidence of abuse or neglect and there appears to be minimal risk to the safety and well-being of the infant. Kentucky officials told us that they envision that CPS will be responsible for developing a plan of safe care for notifications that are accepted for investigation, while hospitals, or another agency, will be responsible for developing plans of safe care for referrals that are screened out by CPS. According to CPS state officials, the plan of safe care for the infant and the family can be part of the discharge plan prior to the family leaving the hospital. However, officials reported that obtaining cooperation from other agencies may be difficult. Some state officials reported being concerned that other agencies may not feel obligated to develop these plans, in part, because CAPTA provides funding to child welfare, and other agencies may therefore believe that child welfare should be responsible for developing the plan of safe care. CPS officials we interviewed in two of our site visit states, as well as one state we followed up with, told us that they were unsure of whether their current plans will meet new CAPTA requirements because CAPTA does not define a plan of safe care. For example, Massachusetts officials said that their plans include everything that a family might need to ensure the safety of the child, including resources to ensure stabilization and reunification of a family, but they are not sure whether the plans meet new CAPTA requirements, in part because they are not familiar with the term \u201cplan of safe care.\u201d An official in another state was also unsure about whether his state\u2019s \u201csafety plans\u201d would meet CAPTA requirements. According to the official, safety plans may include a treatment plan for mothers, and referral services, such as early intervention for the child. In practice, plans of safe care generally address gaps that place an infant at risk for harm or neglect. However, state officials we interviewed reported being unsure about what a plan of safe care should look like for families where these gaps do not exist. Also, in a written response to our survey, one state expressed uncertainty about CPS\u2019 role if required to work with infants who do not typically receive CPS services. For example, a Pennsylvania official said that it is unclear what types of interventions child welfare should conduct with families of infants exposed to legal substances, such as medications prescribed by doctors, when the caregivers are taking their medications correctly. Similarly, officials also questioned whether a plan would be necessary, and what the plan would entail, for caregivers who are already addressing their substance use disorder and taking steps to ensure their infant\u2019s safety. Officials from a local Kentucky CPS office described a case in which a mother was participating in medication-assisted treatment, had attended counseling three times per week throughout her pregnancy, and was continuing treatment in the postpartum period. Through CPS\u2019 investigation, the agency found that the case was not substantiated, in part, because there were no additional services that CPS could connect her with that she was not already receiving. Officials across the three states we visited also said that state and federal drug and alcohol confidentiality restrictions may challenge their ability to monitor plans of safe care. To monitor plans of safe care, CPS staff may need access to confidential information in order to know how caregivers are progressing in treatment, particularly now that these plans must address the substance use disorder needs of the caregiver. However, federal law restricts the disclosure and use of alcohol and drug patient records maintained in connection with the performance of any federal- assisted alcohol and drug abuse program. Generally, confidential information may be disclosed in accordance with the prior written consent of the patient. State and local CPS staff we interviewed said that strict confidentiality requirements make it challenging for drug and alcohol treatment providers to share information about mothers and infants. A CPS state director from Pennsylvania said that treatment providers are often reluctant to provide CPS case workers with information or updates on a mother\u2019s treatment, which prevents child welfare workers from fully understanding how mothers are progressing with their treatment and the extent to which those in treatment are adhering to prescribed directions as outlined by treatment providers. In addition, one official from a state we visited said state statutes regarding sharing of drug and alcohol treatment information may be more restrictive than the federal statute. Some states have developed ways to obtain confidential information about mothers in substance use disorder treatment. For example, officials from one local CPS office told us that in instances when they have to develop a long-term plan of safe care for families, they have mothers sign a release of information form in order to obtain updates about her treatment adherence from the medication- assisted treatment provider. Similarly, a local Massachusetts CPS office told us that typically staff obtain releases from mothers so that they can verify whether mothers are actively participating in their treatment and that there are no records of relapse. In HHS\u2019 role to assist states in the delivery of child welfare services, two agencies\u2014ACF and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\u2014provided technical assistance to states through the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW). In addition, in ACF\u2019s role to administer and monitor states\u2019 implementation of CAPTA, the agency has provided some guidance to states on the provisions pertaining to substance-affected infants and has begun its monitoring responsibilities. ACF and SAMHSA, which leads public health efforts to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness, established the NCSACW in 2002. The NCSACW provides technical assistance to states, and has issued publications and hosted forums to help states develop policies and procedures around issues affecting substance-affected infants. The technical assistance has focused on a broad range of issues, including collaboration among service providers, and plans of safe care. With respect to collaboration, NCSACW has issued several studies that identify opportunities for strengthening interagency efforts to prevent, intervene, identify, and treat prenatal substance exposure. The NCSACW collaboration guides encourage states to involve CPS agencies with medical providers in an interagency collaborative setting, thereby facilitating the process for CPS agencies to be notified of substance- affected infants. Regarding plans of safe care, NCSACW has provided technical assistance and best practices to states around development of these plans. For example, in one state it has facilitated discussion groups to help the state develop a model plan. From calendar year 2011 to 2016, NCSACW processed approximately 600 requests from state CPS agencies for short-term technical assistance related to improving care for substance-affected infants and their families. This short-term technical assistance included activities such as responding to telephone inquiries, mailing information, identifying needed resources, and making referrals. The NCSACW has also provided in- depth assistance to 16 states to strengthen collaboration and linkages across child welfare, addiction treatment, medical communities, early care and education systems, and family courts to improve outcomes for substance-affected infants and their families. Through this in-depth assistance, NCSACW identified areas for improvement in states, including a lack of clarity regarding compliance with CAPTA requirements (such as identification, notification, and developing plans of safe care) and the need for state models to comply with CAPTA requirements to develop plans of safe care. In one state, the project overview report indicated that a next step for the in-depth technical assistance is to continue development of the plan of safe care model and ensure practices and protocols are in place across systems to meet CAPTA requirements. The report indicated that this will include ongoing work with hospitals to ensure consistent identification of infants with prenatal exposure and notifications to CPS. Although18 states reported in our survey that technical assistance from the NCSACW was very or extremely helpful, 11 reported that it was moderately helpful, 7 reported that it was slightly helpful, and 1 reported that it was not at all helpful. Eleven states reported that they were not familiar with this assistance. Since July 2016, when the most recent amendments to CAPTA were enacted, ACF has issued one information memorandum and two program instructions to states about provisions relating to substance-affected infants. According to an ACF official, information memoranda share information with states, while program instructions provide interpretations of the law and inform states of actions they must take. ACF issued an August 2016 information memorandum informing states of the 2016 amendments to CAPTA. The August 2016 information memorandum also provided states with best practices, drawing on an NCSACW guide on collaboration for developing multi-systemic approaches to assist child welfare, medical, substance use disorder treatment, and other systems to support families affected by opioid use disorders. In January 2017, ACF issued a program instruction which provided guidance to states on implementing the 2016 amendments to CAPTA made by CARA and informed states of the flexibilities that they have under the law. Particularly, the guidance noted that: \u201cCAPTA does not define \u2018substance abuse\u2019 or \u2018withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure.\u2019 We recognize that by deleting the term \u2018illegal\u2019 as applied to substance abuse affecting infants, the amendment potentially expands the population of infants and families subject to the provision [that states have policies and procedures in place to address their needs]. States have flexibility to define the phrase, \u2018infants born and identified as being affected by substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure,\u2019 so long as the state\u2019s policies and procedures address the needs of infants born affected by both legal (e.g., prescribed drugs) and illegal substance abuse.\u201d \u201cWhile CAPTA does not specifically define a \u2018plan of safe care,\u2019 CARA amended the CAPTA state plan requirement . . . to require that a plan of safe care address the health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver.\u201d \u201cCAPTA does not specify which agency or entity must develop the plan of safe care; therefore the state may determine which agency will develop the plans. We understand that in most instances the state already has identified the responsible agency in its procedures. When the state reviews and modifies its policies and procedures to incorporate the new safe care plan requirements in CARA, the state may wish to revisit its procedures regarding which agency develops the plan of safe care, including any role for agencies collaborating with CPS in caring for the infant and family.\u201d In addition, in April 2017, ACF issued a program instruction on reporting requirements, including changes in those requirements brought about by the 2016 amendments to CAPTA. ACF conducted limited monitoring of states prior to the amendments passed in 2016. According to ACF officials, if presented with evidence of potential deficiencies, the agency would attempt to learn more about the state\u2019s activities. In one instance, ACF reviewed South Carolina\u2019s policies and found them to not be in compliance with the notification and safe care plan requirements of CAPTA. It directed the state to develop a program improvement plan to bring it into full compliance, which South Carolina submitted in April 2016. In a recent progress report (February\u2013April 2017), South Carolina reported that it was focused on updating statutes, developing policies and procedures, training child protective service workers, and building relations with health care providers. In response to the 2016 amendments to CAPTA that added the requirement for HHS to monitor state policies and procedures to address the needs of substance-affected infants, ACF officials told us that staff in regional offices will review states\u2019 annual reports, submitted in June 2017. In its program instruction describing the reporting requirements, ACF asked each state to submit a new Governor\u2019s Assurance, as well as a narrative explaining what they have done in response to the amendments. Specifically, ACF asked states to provide information on any changes that were made in state laws, policies, or procedures related to identifying and referring infants affected by substance abuse to CPS as a result of prenatal drug exposure. It also requested updates on states\u2019 policies and procedures regarding the development of plans of safe care; a description of how states have developed systems to monitor plans of safe care; and a description of any outreach or coordination efforts the states have taken to implement the amendments, among other things. According to ACF officials, as of October 1, 2017, some states have provided information and a Governor\u2019s Assurance demonstrating compliance with the amended provisions and some states have been placed on Program Improvement Plans, but the agency does not yet have information on the status of all states. An ACF official explained that, in their annual reports, some states either acknowledged that they are trying to get legislation enacted to bring them into compliance with the law and it has failed, or that they are not in compliance, for example, because they were limiting their policies to those infants affected only by illegal substances. In addition, in May 2017, ACF issued a technical bulletin informing states of the new data collection requirements that resulted from the 2016 amendments to CAPTA. ACF stated that it intends to collect data required by the amendments to CAPTA through the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, beginning with states\u2019 submission of fiscal year 2018 data. This system is maintained by ACF and contains data from states about children who have been abused or neglected. ACF issued a Federal Register notice about the proposed data elements and requested comments on the accuracy and quality of the proposed data collection, among other things; the comment period closed in July 2017. In the Federal Register notice, ACF notes that the 2016 amendments to CAPTA require it to collect information from state CPS agencies on the number of notifications from health care providers that are accepted for investigation or screened out. Further, of those infants screened in, ACF is required to collect data on the number of safe care plans developed for substance- affected infants as well as the number of infants for whom a referral was made for appropriate services, including services for the affected family or caregiver. In the Federal Register notice, ACF proposed to collect this information using a combination of existing and new data from states. Thirty-two states reported in our survey that they already collect data on the incidence of substance-affected and/or substance-exposed infants; 15 of those 32 states also collect data on the incidence of NAS. Further, 18 states reported that they collect data on the number of notifications health care providers make to CPS. Of those states, 8 reported that they collect specific data on notifications related to infants diagnosed with NAS. Most states reported in our survey that additional guidance and assistance would be extremely or very helpful (see figure 3). For example, 38 states reported that additional guidance on requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Similarly, 37 states reported that additional guidance on developing, implementing, and monitoring plans to ensure the safety and well-being of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. In written responses to our survey, states suggested ideas for additional guidance, training, and technical assistance to help them address the needs of substance-affected infants. States\u2019 suggestions ranged from assisting in the development of substance abuse training curriculum for staff to video conferences with other states to share information about implementing CAPTA. A few states suggested that the guidance ACF has provided to date is not clear and reported grappling with the meaning of terms such as \u201caffected\u201d and \u201clegal vs. illegal\u201d substances, and two states requested \u201cconcrete guidance\u201d and \u201cspecificity.\u201d A few other states suggested that it would be helpful to obtain additional information about meeting the requirements of plans of safe care within the constraints of state and federal confidentiality laws, technical assistance on what plans of safe care look like, and a format for a plan of safe care. ACF officials told us that states have flexibility with implementing the law and the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance on the amendments to CAPTA made by CARA. ACF officials explained, in October 2017, that they were finalizing their review of the plans that states were required to submit. These plans are expected to include details on how the states are addressing the CAPTA requirements. While ACF could not provide the number, officials reported that some of the state plans submitted to date did not meet the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. They expect states to work with the ACF regional offices, which will provide or facilitate technical assistance to states on their implementation of the provisions, as needed. In addition to the review of state plans, ACF officials explained that regional officials may learn about states\u2019 needs for technical assistance through meetings or informational exchanges. Finally, the NCSACW is expected to review and prepare a summary of CAPTA state plans, current state statutes and policies and procedures relating to amended CAPTA requirements. In addition, according to ACF, NCSACW will continue to offer technical assistance on the development and implementation of plans of safe care to states. Technical assistance may include responding to requests for information, disseminating written materials and resources, and conducting webinars/conference calls. Further, ACF reported that some states will receive more in-depth technical assistance, albeit in some instances on a time-limited basis. Undertaking these actions can enhance states\u2019 understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report. However, more specific guidance from HHS on the issues which states have expressed confusion can assist them in better understanding CAPTA requirements and providing more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need. The opioid epidemic has generated a significant increase in the number of substance-affected infants born and diagnosed with NAS. These vulnerable infants may be at risk for child abuse and neglect if adequate supports and services are not available to ensure their safety. CAPTA requires states to have policies and procedures to address the needs of these infants and their families, including mothers with a substance use disorder. However, states have experienced challenges implementing new CAPTA requirements. Many states reported in our survey that they are not completely adhering to the law. This is reflected in ACF\u2019s review of state plans, some of which are resulting in program improvement plans. States cite challenges that stem, in part, from ACF\u2019s lack of specificity in providing guidance on implementing CAPTA requirements. Specifically, states report that ACF has not provided clear guidance about which substance-affected infants health care providers are required to notify CPS about, as well what a plan of safe care is and for whom it should be developed. Given the challenges that states reported facing in implementing the provisions, a majority reported wanting more help from ACF, such as trainings and teleconferences with other states, to help overcome their challenges. Additional guidance and assistance from HHS would help states better understand what they need to do to develop policies and procedures that meet the needs of children and families affected by substance use. The Secretary of HHS should direct ACF to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements, including the requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance- affected infants and the development of a plan of safe care for these infants. We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHS\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix I. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into our report where appropriate. HHS did not concur with our recommendation. HHS stated that: in January 2017, ACF clarified in guidance several of the issues raised in the report, including the population of infants and families covered by the provision and the state flexibility inherent in determining which infants are \u201caffected by\u201d substance abuse, and the terminology used in the federal law of what a \u201cplan of safe care\u201d is; ACF believes it is necessary to allow states the flexibility to meet the requirements in the context of their state CPS program; several of the challenges that the GAO notes are not specific to CAPTA compliance with the safe care plan and notification requirements; and it does see the value in continuing to provide technical assistance to states to address known challenges and to enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements. With respect to HHS\u2019 January 2017 guidance, state officials reported in our survey and during site visits that they found some terms unclear and were uncertain about what is required of them. In written responses to our survey, states reported challenges understanding how to define substance-affected under CAPTA. In addition, as we note in our report, the guidance about plans of safe care described the following: \u201cWhile CAPTA does not specifically define a \u2018plan of safe care,\u2019 CARA amended the CAPTA state plan requirement . . . to require that a plan of safe care address the health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver.\u201d States reported in our survey and in follow-up discussions that this lack of specificity remained an ongoing challenge for them. For example, as we discuss in our report, one state that we followed up with in August 2017 was still unsure about whether its safety plans would meet CAPTA requirements for plans of safe care. In addition, as of October 2017, HHS confirmed that some state plans did not meet CAPTA requirements and that the states were asked to develop program improvement plans. Accordingly, a key ongoing challenge was not addressed by the January guidance. Regarding allowing states flexibility to meet CAPTA requirements, we acknowledge in our report that HHS said that states have flexibility. However, in our survey and site visits, states indicated that they would find it helpful for HHS to provide them with greater specificity around terms, including the degree of flexibility they are allowed. States added that this would include parameters within which they can develop policies and procedures that meet CAPTA requirements. We continue to believe that additional guidance addressing these concerns would benefit states and could be provided without imposing additional mandates. Concerning HHS\u2019 third point that some of the issues raised in the report are not specific to CAPTA, the states we visited interpret CAPTA to require that plans of safe care be developed for all substance-affected infants who are referred to CPS. During our discussions with states and in responses to our survey, state officials did not delineate which federal requirement impacted their approach to serving children and families. As stated in our conclusion, vulnerable infants may be at risk for child abuse and neglect if adequate supports and services are not available to ensure their safety. Lastly, HHS indicated that it will continue to provide technical assistance to states and fund demonstration sites to establish or enhance collaboration across community agencies and courts. Although continuing to provide technical assistance to states should be beneficial, our findings demonstrate that additional guidance is also needed. For example, 38 states reported that additional guidance on requirements for health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Similarly, 37 states reported that additional guidance on developing, implementing, and monitoring plans to ensure the safety and well-being of substance-affected infants would be extremely or very helpful. Overall, given the results of our review, we continue to believe our recommendation is warranted. Effective implementation of our recommendation should help states better implement protections for children.

                "Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare\u2014a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need. GAO recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements. HHS did not concur with the recommendation. As discussed in the report, GAO continues to believe that added guidance would benefit states."

            "context": "According to NRC\u2019s website, the higher the radiation dose, the sooner the effects of radiation will appear, and the higher the probability of death. Radiation doses such as those received by survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan can cause cancers such as leukemia and colon cancer and, if levels are high enough, acute radiation syndrome. The symptoms of this syndrome range from nausea, fatigue, and vomiting to death within days or weeks. In contrast, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect. In particular, below about 100 millisieverts (mSv) (10 rem)\u2014the level below which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u2019s (National Academies) 2006 report on radiation and human health considered radiation to be low dose\u2014data do not definitively establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure. In developing and applying radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public\u2014specifically, limits on dose or increased health risk and guidance levels on exposure\u2014EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies. In particular, they have relied on the advice of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies\u2019 Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. This advice includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. For example, the National Academies published a report in 2006 stating that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. According to the National Academies, the availability of new and more extensive data since the publication of its previous report in 1990 strengthened confidence in the 2006 report\u2019s estimates of cancer risk. The advisory bodies have recognized challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure when using the linear no-threshold model. For example, much of the data on health effects of radiation exposure come from non-U.S. populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors. These individuals received a large exposure to radiation over a short period of time (an acute exposure), and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for these populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly (chronically) exposed to low-dose radiation. Nevertheless, NRC officials told us that, in the absence of convincing evidence that there is a dose threshold below which low levels of radiation are beneficial or not harmful, NRC will continue to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no- threshold model. Similarly, officials from EPA told us that they would consider changing the use of the linear no-threshold model as the basis of their requirements and guidance only if there were a strong recommendation from scientific advisory bodies on radiation protection as well as an endorsement of the change by the National Academies. Under this model, federal regulations set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level in the National Academies\u2019 2006 report on radiation and human health for defining low-dose radiation. For example, NRC\u2019s annual dose limit for members of the public (excluding natural, or background, sources of radiation) from operation of nuclear power plants is a hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose. NRC based the dose limit on an advisory body recommendation that the cancer risk to the general public from exposure to radiation should be comparable to the public\u2019s risk from everyday activities, such as taking public transportation. The low-dose radiation limits and guidance that federal agencies have developed and applied vary depending on the settings in which exposure can occur. For example, NRC has established limits on occupational dose that apply to nuclear power-plant workers; these limits are higher than NRC\u2019s annual dose limit for members of the public but are still below the level the National Academies considers low dose. In keeping with advisory body recommendations, NRC also applies the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). NRC defines ALARA to mean making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to radiation as far below dose limits as is practical. At a nuclear power plant we visited as part of our work, representatives told us that under their ALARA plan, the plant set its own dose limit for workers at 40 percent of the NRC\u2019s regulatory limit. Moreover, officials at the plant told us that they have been able to keep exposures below the plant\u2019s own limit by continuously seeking opportunities to reduce unnecessary worker exposure to radiation, such as using robots to perform maintenance work in radiation areas. In contrast to radiation exposure received from nuclear power plants, FDA officials stated that the agency regulates the maximum radiation output of medical equipment, instead of setting limits on the total amount of radiation exposure to patients. According to FDA officials, FDA does not generally have the authority to regulate the total amount of radiation exposure a patient receives from medical imaging equipment. However, in keeping with the principle that radiation exposure should be kept as low as reasonably achievable, FDA encourages voluntary measures by health care providers, such as to investigate and determine whether it is possible to reduce radiation exposure to patients from the use of medical- imaging equipment. From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, seven federal agencies obligated $209.6 million for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. DOE and NIH accounted for most of the funding, with DOE obligating $116.3 million and NIH obligating $88.6 million, or about 56 percent and 42 percent of the total, respectively. The five other agencies\u2014NRC, NASA, DOD, EPA, and CDC\u2014obligated the remaining $4.7 million, or about 2 percent of the total. DOE has two offices that have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation\u2014the Office of Science and the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security\u2014according to funding information DOE provided. The Office of Science established the Low Dose Radiation Research Program in 1998 and funded it through fiscal year 2016. A primary focus of this program was radiobiological research, which examines molecular and cellular responses to radiation exposure. According to DOE\u2019s website for the program, the program provided data and information about the low-dose range of exposure, producing 737 peer-reviewed publications as of March 2012. The Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security provided funding for epidemiological studies, including studies involving Japanese atomic bomb survivors. NIH has funded and conducted both epidemiological and radiobiological studies on low-dose radiation, according to NIH officials. The officials stated that the studies are conducted through the National Cancer Institute\u2019s internal research program for radiation epidemiology, as well as through NIH\u2019s research programs for external funding of investigator- initiated research. Other institutes of NIH, including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, also fund research related to the health effects of radiation exposure as part of NIH\u2019s overall mission to fund medical research. Among the other agencies that provided some funding to low-dose radiation studies, several provided funding to the Epidemiological Study of One Million U.S. Radiation Workers and Veterans (Million Person Study)\u2014an ongoing study headed by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. DOE also provided funding for this study. In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the seven agencies who provided funding for research on health effects of low-dose radiation collectively decreased their annual funding obligations in this area by 48 percent, from $57.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to $30.4 million in fiscal year 2016. DOE accounted for a large portion of this overall decrease in annual funding. Specifically, over this 5-year period, DOE reduced its annual funding obligations for this area of research by 45 percent\u2014from $32.6 million in fiscal year 2012 to $18.0 million in fiscal year 2016. According to DOE, the decrease was primarily due to DOE\u2019s reduction in funding for its Low Dose Radiation Research Program. According to DOE officials, decreases in funding for the program reflected a shift toward bioenergy and environmental research. Similarly, over the 5-year period, NIH\u2019s funding for low-dose radiation research decreased by 48 percent\u2014from $23.1 million in fiscal year 2012 to $12.0 million in fiscal year 2016. NIH officials explained that funding levels for a particular disease or research area can fluctuate depending on several factors, including the number and quality of research proposals submitted and the outcome of NIH\u2019s peer reviews of the proposals, as well as the overall research budget. The seven agencies that funded research on health effects of low-dose radiation for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 collaborated on particular research projects through various mechanisms, including joint funding of individual projects, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities. As previously noted, the 2016 report of DOE\u2019s Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee provided information about research needs in low-dose radiation and found that further research could decrease uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. The report stated that other agencies\u2014including NRC, NIH, EPA, DOD, and NASA\u2014could benefit from the reduction in uncertainty that could be obtained by this research. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. We made this recommendation because our previous work has shown that collaborative mechanisms can serve multiple purposes, such as leading interagency efforts to develop and coordinate sound science and technology policies across the federal government. Although collaborative mechanisms differ in complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain key features, such as leadership. We directed this recommendation to DOE for several reasons. In the past, DOE took a leading role in advocating for greater communication and coordination between the fields of radiation biology and epidemiology. In addition, DOE is the federal agency that currently has primary responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for research related to the protection of health during activities that can result in exposure to radiation. DOE is well positioned to lead an effort to ensure that federal agencies have a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects because of the agency\u2019s past experience as a leader in this area of research. Such an effort could help DOE and the collaborating agencies determine roles and responsibilities, including leadership when addressing shared research priorities. DOE did not agree with our recommendation. In particular, DOE stated that EPA and NRC also have legal mandates to research low-dose radiation exposure and that these agencies establish their research priorities in accordance with their respective budget authorities and recommendations from independent advisory bodies. DOE stated that as a result, it would not be appropriate for DOE to lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration. We believe that DOE\u2019s concerns stem from a misinterpretation of our recommendation, and we made several changes to our report and our recommendation to clarify DOE\u2019s role. We noted that we did not recommend that a mechanism for interagency collaboration serve as a replacement for agencies\u2019 legal mandates, budget authorities, and recommendations from independent advisory bodies. Instead, this mechanism would help agencies address shared research priorities. In making our recommendation, we did not specify the coordinating mechanism that agencies should use and instead left it to DOE to lead the development of an appropriate mechanism. We continue to believe that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

                "This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

            "context": "Black lung benefits include both cash assistance and medical benefits. Maximum cash assistance payments generally ranged from about $650 to $1,300 per month in fiscal year 2017, depending on the number of dependents the miner has. Miners receiving cash assistance are also eligible for medical benefits that cover the treatment of their black-lung- related conditions, which may include hospital and nursing care, rehabilitation services, and drug and equipment charges, according to DOL documentation. DOL estimates that the average annual cost for medical treatment in fiscal year 2017 was approximately $6,980 per miner. There were about 25,700 total beneficiaries (primary and dependents) receiving black lung benefits during fiscal year 2017 (see fig. 1). The decrease in the number of beneficiaries over time has resulted from a combination of declining coal mining employment and an aging beneficiary population, according to DOL officials. Further, black lung beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form, progressive massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners, according to HHS officials. Black lung claims are processed by DOL\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. Contested claims are adjudicated by DOL\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges, which issues decisions that can be appealed to the Benefits Review Board. Claimants and mine operators may further appeal these agency decisions to the federal courts. If an award is contested, claimants can receive interim benefits, which are generally paid from the Trust Fund according to DOL officials, while their claims are in the appeals process. Final awards are either funded by mine operators\u2014who are identified as the responsible employers of claimants\u2014or the Trust Fund, when responsible employers cannot be identified or do not pay. In fiscal year 2017, black lung claims had an approval rate of about 29 percent, according to DOL data. Of the 19,430 primary black lung beneficiaries receiving benefits during fiscal year 2017, 64 percent (12,464) were paid from the Trust Fund, 25 percent (4,798) were paid by liable mine operators, and 11 percent (2,168) were receiving interim benefits, according to DOL officials. Black Lung Disability Trust Fund revenue is primarily obtained from mine operators through the coal tax. The coal tax is imposed at two rates, depending on whether the coal is extracted from underground or surface mines. The current tax rates are $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. Therefore, if a ton of underground-mined coal is sold for less than $25, than the tax paid would be less than $1.10. For instance, if a ton of underground-mined coal sold for $20, than it would be taxed at 4.4 percent of the sales price, or $0.88. To a lesser extent, the Trust Fund also receives other miscellaneous revenue from interest payments, and various fines and penalties paid by mine operators, among other sources, according to DOL documentation. Coal tax revenue is collected from mine operators by Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service and then transferred to the Trust Fund where it is then used by DOL officials to pay black lung benefits and the costs of administering the program. Trust Fund expenditures include, among other things, black lung benefit payments, certain administrative costs incurred by DOL and Treasury to administer the black lung benefits program, and debt repayments. When necessary for the Trust Fund to make relevant expenditures under federal law, the Trust Fund borrows from the Treasury\u2019s general fund. When this occurs, the federal government is essentially borrowing from itself\u2014and hence from the general taxpayer\u2014to fund its benefit payments and other expenditures. Multiple factors have challenged Trust Fund finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenue, interest payments have grown, and legislative actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. Combined black lung benefit payments and program administrative costs exceeded Trust Fund revenue every year for the program\u2019s first decade (fiscal years 1979 through 1989), resulting in the accrual of debt. During the Trust Fund\u2019s first three fiscal years in particular, revenue covered less than 40 percent of the Trust Fund\u2019s combined benefit payments and administrative costs. For instance, in fiscal year 1980, the Trust Fund received about $251 million in revenue and paid about $726 million in black lung benefits and administrative costs. Beginning in 1982, revenue increased as a result of the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 that doubled the coal tax rates from $0.50 to $1 per ton of underground-mined coal and from $0.25 to $0.50 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4 percent of the sales price. Even with the tax rate increase, combined benefit payments and administrative costs continued to exceed revenue throughout the 1980s (see fig. 2). As a result, the Trust Fund borrowed from Treasury\u2019s general fund to cover the annual differences between its expenditures and revenues, and by fiscal year 1989 the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt to Treasury\u2019s general fund exceeded $3 billion. Beginning in fiscal year 1990, Trust Fund revenue generally began to exceed combined benefit payments and administrative costs, and, in fact, total Trust Fund cumulative revenue collected from fiscal years 1979 through 2017 exceeded total cumulative benefit payments and administrative costs incurred during these years. However, interest owed from earlier years of borrowing led to more borrowing and debt. From fiscal years 1979 through 1989, the Trust Fund borrowed\u2014primarily through 30-year term loans according to Treasury officials\u2014from Treasury\u2019s general fund at interest rates that varied from about 6.5 percent to about 13.9 percent. In fiscal year 1985, for instance, the Trust Fund paid about $275 million in interest, which was equal to about half of the total revenue collected that year. Since fiscal year 1990, revenue has generally exceeded combined benefit payments and administrative costs, although interest payments on the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt kept the fund in a position whereby its total expenditures continued to exceed its total revenues. As a result, the principal amount of the Trust Fund\u2019s total outstanding debt to Treasury\u2019s general fund increased and exceeded $10 billion by fiscal year 2008. Legislation has been enacted over the years that was expected to improve Trust Fund finances: In 1981, the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 doubled the coal tax rates from $0.50 cents to $1 per ton of underground-mined coal, and from $0.25 cents to $0.50 cents per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4 percent of the sales price (as mentioned previously). In 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 established a 5 year moratorium on interest accrual with respect to repayable advances to the Trust Fund (which we refer to as annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund), and increased the coal tax rates to $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal, and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal (up to 4.4 percent of the sales price), where they have remained since. In 2008, the EIEA included provisions that were expected to eliminate the Trust Fund\u2019s debt. Specifically, EIEA (1) generally extended the coal tax rates at their current rates until December 31, 2018 (after which they are scheduled to decrease to their original levels of $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal, and $0.25 per ton of surface- mined coal, up to 2 percent of the sales price); (2) provided for a one- time federal appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness (about $6.5 billion, according to DOL data); and (3) provided for the refinancing of the Trust Fund\u2019s debt that was not forgiven as a result of EIEA (which we refer to as the Trust Fund\u2019s legacy debt). Specifically, the Trust Fund\u2019s legacy debt was refinanced with more favorable interest rates, according to DOL data. Interest rates on the refinanced legacy debt range from about 1.4 percent to about 4.5 percent. The forgiveness and refinancing of Trust Fund debt along with extending the current coal tax rates through 2018 were expected to result in annual tax revenue that could be used to pay down interest and principal on the Trust Fund\u2019s legacy debt, according to DOL and Treasury officials. These officials said that models showed that debt would be eliminated by fiscal year 2040; however, they noted that coal tax revenue has been less than originally projected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased market competition from other energy sources. As a result, the Trust Fund\u2019s total expenditures continued to exceed revenue and the Trust Fund borrowed from Treasury\u2019s general fund each year from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayments expenditures. In fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund\u2019s total principal amount of outstanding debt, which includes its legacy debt and the amount borrowed from Treasury\u2019s general fund that year, was about $4.3 billion (see fig. 3). Trust Fund borrowing will likely continue to increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the scheduled coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production, according to our moderate simulation. We simulated the effects of the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease on Trust Fund finances through 2050, and in this report, we generally present the results of a moderate case set of assumptions (see table 1). These simulations are not predictions of what will happen, but rather models of what could happen given certain assumptions. For more information on our simulation methodology see appendix I. In addition to the moderate case assumptions, we also simulated how Trust Fund debt could change through 2050 given various other assumptions, and the full range of results for all of our simulations are presented in appendix II. Our moderate case simulation suggests that Trust Fund revenue may decrease, from about $485 million in fiscal year 2018 to about $298 million in fiscal year 2019, due, in part, to the scheduled approximate 55 percent decrease in the coal tax. Our simulation, which incorporates EIA data on future expected coal production, also shows that annual Trust Fund revenue will likely continue to decrease beyond fiscal year 2019 due, in part, to declining coal production. Domestic coal production has declined from about 1.2 billion tons in 2008 to about 728 million tons in 2016, according to EIA. Based on these projections, our moderate simulation shows that Trust Fund annual revenue may continue to decrease from about $298 million in fiscal year 2019 to about $197 million in fiscal year 2050 (see fig. 4). With the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, our moderate case simulation suggests that expected revenue will likely be insufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments and administrative costs, as well as debt repayment expenditures. Specifically, our moderate case simulation suggests that revenue may not be sufficient to cover beneficiary payments and administrative costs from fiscal years 2020 through 2050 (see fig. 5). For instance, in fiscal year 2029, simulated benefit payments and administrative costs will likely exceed simulated revenue by about $99 million. These annual deficits will likely decrease over time to about $4 million by fiscal year 2050 due, in part, to the assumed continued net decline in total black lung beneficiaries. Our simulation also therefore suggests that Trust Fund revenue may not be enough to also cover the debt repayment expenditures it must continue to make through fiscal year 2040, per the payment schedule established following the 2008 EIEA. Our moderate simulation suggests that the amount borrowed by the Trust Fund will likely increase from about $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to about $15.4 billion in fiscal year 2050 (see fig. 6). Although the Trust Fund\u2019s legacy debt decreases through fiscal year 2040, total Trust Fund expenditures\u2014including combined benefit payments and administrative costs as well as debt repayments\u2014will likely continue to exceed revenue which will require continued annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund. However, the amount borrowed by the Trust Fund could vary depending, in part, on future coal production and the number of new beneficiaries and could range between about $6 billion and about $27 billion in 2050, according to our simulations (see appendix II). We simulated three options that can affect Trust Fund finances through fiscal year 2050. Specifically, we simulated the effects of (1) adjusting the coal tax, (2) forgiving interest, and (3) forgiving debt. In each of the simulations, we compared the results of the option to a baseline in which the coal tax rates will decrease by about 55 percent, which we refer to as the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease. We compare interest and debt forgiveness options to a baseline which assumes the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease has taken effect, and that there is no interest or debt forgiveness. The simulated options are not intended to be exhaustive and we are not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. Using the moderate case, we simulated four options: (1) implementing the 2019 coal tax rate reduction to $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal; (2) maintaining the current coal tax rates of $1.10 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal; (3) reducing the tax rates by 25 percent (from $1.10 and $0.55); and (4) increasing these tax rates by 25 percent (see fig. 7). Increasing the tax rates by 25 percent was the only option that eliminated simulated Trust Fund debt by fiscal year 2050, according to our moderate case simulation. We simulated three interest forgiveness options including forgiving interest on (1) legacy debt, (2) annual borrowing, and (3) all debt. Our moderate case simulation suggests that forgiving interest will not eliminate simulated debt by fiscal year 2050 (see fig. 8). We simulated two debt forgiveness options by forgiving principal and interest on (1) legacy debt and (2) all debt. Our moderate case simulation suggests that both debt forgiveness options would reduce simulated Trust Fund borrowing by fiscal year 2050, but these options would not eliminate debt altogether as simulated revenue will likely not be enough to cover simulated expenditures (see fig. 9). In these cases, the Trust Fund will need to continue borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund to cover annual deficits, and thus accumulate debt. While adjusting coal tax rates and forgiving interest or debt could reduce the Trust Fund\u2019s simulated borrowing by 2050, implementing them could affect the coal industry or general taxpayers, according to stakeholders we interviewed. For instance, a coal industry representative noted that maintaining the coal tax at its current rate would continue to burden the coal industry and increasing the tax would exacerbate the burden at a time when coal production has been declining. Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be borne by the general taxpayer since Treasury borrows from taxpayers to lend to the Trust Fund as needed. These officials also said that making a one-time federal appropriation to forgive interest or debt would be the most transparent way to satisfy the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt to Treasury\u2019s general fund. In addition to the simulations, other options could affect the financial position of the Trust Fund including reducing black lung benefits, eliminating or adjusting the coal tax cap, or creating a variable coal tax. Our moderate case simulation suggests that completely eliminating black lung benefits as of fiscal year 2019 could reduce the Trust Fund\u2019s borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund in fiscal year 2050 from about $15.4 billion to about $6.4 billion. However, doing so would generally mean that coal tax revenue would be collected solely to fund the repayment of Trust Fund debt. Another option could be to eliminate or adjust the coal tax cap, which currently prevents mine operators from paying a coal tax of more than 4.4 percent of the price per ton of coal sold. If the coal tax cap were eliminated, for instance, mine operators would pay $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0. 55 per ton of surface-mined coal regardless of price sold, which could increase revenue. As an additional option, changing the structure of the coal tax to flexible rates that change based on an annual actuarial assessment of the Trust Fund could help to ensure that coal mine operators pay the necessary amount of tax to cover Trust Fund expenditures, without resulting in a Trust Fund balance or deficit. Multiple options could reduce the Trust Fund\u2019s future debt and distribute the financial burden among the coal industry and general taxpayers. We simulated whether various coal tax and debt forgiveness options could balance the Trust Fund by fiscal year 2050, whereby its simulated revenue would be sufficient to cover its simulated expenditures. These options were selected, in part, based on interviews with Trust Fund stakeholders and the availability of DOL and other data. We approached these simulations from two perspectives. First, we simulated how much Trust Fund debt would need to be forgiven based on various coal tax rates. Second, we simulated the average tax collected per ton needed to balance the Trust Fund by 2050, based on certain debt forgiveness options. The simulated options are not intended to be exhaustive and we are not endorsing any particular combination of options. Our first set of options using the moderate case simulations are based on the current coal tax rates of $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, and show the amount of debt forgiveness in fiscal year 2019 needed to balance the Trust Fund by fiscal year 2050 based on certain tax rates (see fig. 10). Specifically, our moderate case simulations show the following: Increasing current coal tax rates by 25 percent could balance the Trust Fund by 2050 and would likely require no debt forgiveness. For this option, the simulated coal tax revenue would likely be sufficient to cover simulated Trust Fund expenditures, including combined benefit payments and administrative costs, as well as debt repayments. However, this option would place the burden solely on the coal industry that would be paying higher taxes at a time when coal production has been declining. Maintaining current coal tax rates could balance the Trust Fund by 2050 if coupled with about $2.4 billion of debt forgiveness. This option would distribute the burden among the coal industry and general taxpayers. Decreasing current coal tax rates by 25 percent could balance the Trust Fund by 2050 if coupled with about $4.8 billion in debt forgiveness. This option would burden the coal industry less than maintaining the current tax rates, but would increase the burden on general taxpayers. Decreasing current tax rates by 55 percent, which we refer to as the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, would balance the Trust Fund by 2050 if coupled with about $7.8 billion in debt forgiveness. This figure comprises the Trust Fund\u2019s total simulated outstanding debt in fiscal year 2019 ($6.6 billion), and an additional about $1.2 billion that would be required because the Trust Fund will accrue additional debt from fiscal years 2020 through 2050, according to our moderate case simulations. The coal industry would bear some of the financial burden of this option, while also placing a financial burden on general taxpayers. Our second set of options using moderate case simulations show the change in average coal tax revenue collected per ton to balance the Trust Fund by fiscal year 2050 based on certain debt forgiveness options (see fig. 11). Specifically, our moderate simulations show the following: Forgiving the Trust Fund\u2019s legacy debt would allow for an average tax collected of about $0.59 per ton to balance the Trust Fund by 2050. Based on certain assumptions, this could be accomplished with a tax of $0.88 per ton on underground-mined coal and $0.44 per ton on surface-mined coal. Forgiving all Trust Fund debt would allow for an average tax collected per ton of coal sold of $0.47 per ton to balance the Trust Fund by 2050. Based on certain assumptions, this could be accomplished with a tax of $0.70 per ton on underground-mined coal and a tax of $0.35 per ton of surface-mined coal. We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Labor (DOL), Treasury, and Health and Human Services (HHS) for review and comment. DOL, Treasury, and HHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time we will send copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff should have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or brownbarnesc@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. We examined the extent to which (1) Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) debt may change through 2050 and (2) selected options to improve its future financial position. We interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor (DOL), Treasury, and Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as representatives from the National Mining Association and the United Mine Workers of America. We then selected options to simulate based, in part, on these interviews and the availability of DOL and other data. These options included adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest on some or all Trust Fund debt, forgiving some or all Trust Fund debt, or various combinations of these options. The options we simulated are not intended to be exhaustive and we are not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. Our simulations are based on various assumptions and simulate Trust Fund revenues and expenditures from fiscal years 2016 through 2050. To develop these simulations, we used actual and projection data from (1) DOL for fiscal years 2015 through 2040; (2) Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis for fiscal years 2011 through 2015; (3) the Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA) for calendar years 2015 through 2050; and (4) the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year 2017. To simulate future Trust Fund benefit expenditures, we simulated the number of beneficiaries each fiscal year, and the annual average amount of benefits received (cash assistance and medical benefits). To simulate the numbers of beneficiaries, we used DOL data on the (1) age distributions of miner and widow beneficiaries for fiscal year 2015; (2) mortality rates by age for miner and widow beneficiaries as of fiscal year 2015; and (3) numbers of beneficiaries\u2014including married miners, single miners, widows, and miners receiving medical benefits only\u2014in fiscal year 2015. We assumed\u2014as DOL does in its Black Lung Budget and Liability Model\u2014that all miners are men, all widows are women, and all spouses are 3 years younger than the miner. We also assumed that the age distribution of single miners is the same as for married miners, and that the age distribution of new miner and widow beneficiaries is the same as for miner and widow beneficiaries during fiscal year 2015. We used DOL\u2019s mortality rates to simulate the number of beneficiaries of each age and type in each year, and used those numbers to then simulate the total number of beneficiaries of each type each year (see table 2). We also assumed that there will be no new medical-benefit-only recipients. Formula The number of married miner beneficiaries age a in fiscal year y is equal to the number of new married miner beneficiaries age a in fiscal year y plus the number of married miner beneficiaries age a-1 in fiscal year y-1 who survived and whose spouse survived. The total number of married miner beneficiaries in fiscal year y is then the sum of the number of married miner beneficiaries of all ages in fiscal year y. Finally, we averaged the number of married miner beneficiaries by averaging the prior fiscal year\u2019s total and the current fiscal year\u2019s total. The number of single miner beneficiaries age a in fiscal year y is equal to the number of new single miner beneficiaries age a in fiscal year y plus the number of single miner beneficiaries age a-1 in fiscal year y-1 who survived plus the number of married miner beneficiaries age a-1 in fiscal year y-1 who survived but whose spouse did not survive. The total number of single miner beneficiaries in fiscal year y is then the sum of the number of single miner beneficiaries of all ages in fiscal year y. Finally, we averaged the number of single miner beneficiaries by averaging the prior fiscal year\u2019s total and the current fiscal year\u2019s total. The number of widow beneficiaries age a in fiscal year y is equal to the number of new beneficiaries who are widows age a in fiscal year y plus the number of widow beneficiaries age a-1 in fiscal year y-1 who survived plus the number of married miner beneficiaries age a+2 in fiscal year y-1 who did not survive but whose spouse did survive. The total number of widow beneficiaries in fiscal year y is then the sum of the number of widow beneficiaries of all ages in fiscal year y. Finally, we averaged the number of widow beneficiaries by averaging the prior fiscal year\u2019s total and the current fiscal year\u2019s total. The number of MBO beneficiaries of age a in fiscal year y is equal to the number of MBO beneficiaries of age a-1 in fiscal year y-1 who survived. The total number of MBO beneficiaries only in fiscal year y is then the sum of the number of MBO beneficiaries of all ages in fiscal year y. Finally, we averaged the number of MBO beneficiaries by averaging the prior fiscal year\u2019s total and the current fiscal year\u2019s total. To simulate future coal tax revenue, we used Treasury and EIA data to calculate (1) the amounts of underground and surface-mined coal taxed at fixed dollar amounts of $1.10 and $0.55 per ton, respectively, in 2015; (2) the amounts of underground and surface-mined coal taxed at variable dollar amounts per ton equal to 4.4 percent of the price in 2015; and (3) average prices of underground and surface-mined coal taxed at 4.4 percent of the price in 2015. We then used EIA data on projected amounts of total coal production, underground-mined coal production, lignite coal production, and coal exports, as well as projected average coal prices, for the period from 2015 through 2050 to simulate future coal tax revenues (see table 3). We simulated other Trust Fund expenditures and revenues, including administrative costs and debt repayments (see table 4). For our simulations, total Trust Fund expenditures are the sum of black lung benefits (cash assistance and medical benefits), total administrative costs, repayment of interest and principal on outstanding debt to Treasury\u2019s general fund, and other expenditures. Total Trust Fund revenues are the sum of coal tax revenue and other miscellaneous revenue, and exclude annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund. Annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund is the difference between total Trust Fund expenditures and revenues and is assumed to be repaid with interest the following year. If total revenues are greater than total expenditures, then the Trust Fund has a balance and would not have to borrow that year. In this case, we assumed that the Trust Fund will earn interest on that balance at the same rate on which interest would accrue on annual borrowing. We simulated how the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease and various options including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving debt interest, and forgiving debt principal and interest may affect Trust Fund finances through fiscal year 2050 (see table 5). The options listed are not intended to be exhaustive and we are not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. We simulated option combinations for coal tax rates, interest forgiveness, and debt forgiveness to demonstrate how potential financial adjustments could affect future Trust Fund borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund through fiscal year 2050. For options that involve adjusting coal tax rates, we estimated the amount of debt that would need to be forgiven in fiscal year 2019 for the Trust Fund\u2019s revenues to be sufficient to cover its expenditures through fiscal year 2050, assuming the Trust Fund does not borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. To do so, we first calculated the real discounted present value of Trust Fund expenditures for fiscal years 2019 through 2050, including benefit payments, administrative costs, legacy debt repayments, and repayment of annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund. Second, we calculated the real discounted present value of Trust Fund revenue for the same period, including coal tax revenue and other miscellaneous revenue. Third, we calculated debt forgiveness as the difference between the real discounted present value of Trust Fund expenditures from the first calculation and the real discounted present value of Trust Fund revenues from the second calculation. When the amount of debt forgiveness is greater than the amount of debt outstanding, the Trust Fund would need an additional cash inflow in addition to forgiveness of all outstanding debt. Amounts of debt forgiveness less than zero suggest that no debt forgiveness is required. For options involving forgiving debt (interest or principal), we estimated the average tax per ton of coal that, if implemented in fiscal year 2019, would provide the Trust Fund sufficient revenue to cover its expenditures through fiscal year 2050, assuming the Trust Fund does not receive any advances from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. To do so, we first calculated the real discounted present value of Trust Fund expenditures for the period from fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2050, again including benefit payments, administrative costs, legacy debt repayments, and repayment of annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund, minus the real discounted present value of miscellaneous revenues for the same period. Second, we calculated the real discounted present value of coal production for the same period. Third, we calculated the average tax per ton of coal as the first amount divided by the second amount. To assess the sensitivity of each option, we ran each simulation 36 times using four different sets of assumptions about the numbers of future beneficiaries and nine different sets of assumptions about future coal production and prices (see table 6). Doing so provided a range of estimates about the Trust Fund\u2019s future borrowing needs and provided insight on the sensitivity of its overall financial position relative to its various expenditures and revenues. The analysis also provided a range of estimates of the amount of debt forgiveness needed to bring the Trust Fund into balance by fiscal year 2050, assuming various coal tax rates, and the average tax collection per ton needed to do the same, and assuming various amounts of debt forgiveness. From the range of estimates that resulted from our sensitivity analysis, we selected cases with moderate expectations related to future Trust Fund expenditures and revenue. Specifically, for future expenditures, we assumed an average growth rate of new black lung beneficiaries for fiscal years 2003 through 2015 as a moderate case that reflects historical experience. For future revenue, we used a moderate coal production outlook based on EIA\u2019s reference case, which reflects moderate expectations about future coal production based on various assumptions about economic growth, oil prices, technological innovation, and energy policy. We summarized the results of our simulations by showing the extent to which the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund\u2019s (Trust Fund) balance\u2014the sum of tax revenue and miscellaneous revenue less expenditures\u2014may change in fiscal year 2050 for each option simulated. For example, with the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, our moderate case simulations suggest that the Trust Fund would likely have a deficit in fiscal year 2050 of about $15.4 billion. Multiple options could reduce the Trust Fund\u2019s future debt and distribute the financial burden among the coal industry and general taxpayers. We simulated how various coal tax and debt forgiveness options could balance the Trust Fund by fiscal year 2050, whereby its simulated revenue would be sufficient to cover its simulated expenditures. We approached these simulations from two perspectives. First, we simulated how much Trust Fund debt would need to be forgiven based on various coal tax rates. Second, we simulated the average tax collected per ton needed to balance the Trust Fund by 2050, based on certain debt forgiveness options. For our first set of simulations, we calculated the amount of debt outstanding in fiscal year 2019 and the amount that would likely need to be forgiven in fiscal year 2019 for the Trust Fund to have sufficient revenues to cover its expenditures by fiscal year 2050, assuming that it does not borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. For example, before any options are implemented, our moderate case simulations suggest that the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt in fiscal year 2019\u2014including both legacy debt and annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund\u2014would likely be about $6.6 billion (after discounting and adjusting for inflation). Therefore, with implementation of the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent as scheduled in calendar year 2019, about 117.7 percent of that debt would need to be forgiven to balance the Trust Fund. In other words, balancing the Trust Fund would require forgiveness of $6.6 billion and an additional cash inflow of about $1.2 billion because the Trust Fund will accrue additional debt from fiscal years 2020 through 2050, according to our moderate case simulations (see table 8). For our second set of simulations, we estimated the average tax per ton of coal that, if implemented in fiscal year 2019, would likely provide the Trust Fund sufficient revenues to cover its expenditures in fiscal year 2050, assuming that it does not borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. For example, if all principal and interest on Trust Fund legacy debt is forgiven, as of 2019, the estimated average tax that balances the Trust Fund is about $0.59 per ton (see table 9). Based on certain assumptions, this could be accomplished with a tax of $0.88 per ton on underground-mined coal and $0.44 per ton on surface-mined coal.

                "With revenue of about $450 million in fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund paid about $184 million in benefits to more than 25,000 coal miners and eligible dependents. However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."

            "context": "Created in 1968, the SFSP is authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and generally provides free meals to children age 18 and under in low-income areas during certain periods when school is not in session. Specifically, the SFSP operates during school summer vacation periods between May through September, vacation periods in any month for programs operating on a continuous school calendar, and certain other times for areas affected by an unanticipated school closure, such as for a natural disaster. However, the majority of SFSP meals are served to children during the summer months. In fiscal years 2007 through 2016, federal expenditures on SFSP increased, according to FNS data, though there was a slight decrease between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (see fig. 1). The SFSP is administered at the federal level by FNS through its national and regional offices. FNS is responsible for issuing regulations, instructions, and guidance; reviewing states\u2019 program management and administration plans; overseeing program administration; and reimbursing states for meals served that meet program requirements. At the state level, the program is administered by state agencies and locally operated by state-approved sponsors, such as school districts, local government entities, or private nonprofit organizations. State agencies are responsible for approving, providing training to, and inspecting and monitoring sponsors and meal sites. Sponsors, in turn, are responsible for monitoring their SFSP meal sites, managing the meal service, and providing training to administrative staff and site operators. A sponsor may operate one site or multiple sites. Sites are physical locations in the community where children receive and consume meals in a supervised setting. According to FNS guidance, sites may be located in a variety of settings, including schools, parks, community centers, health clinics, hospitals, apartment complexes, churches, and migrant camps. States may approve different types of SFSP meal sites, including open sites, closed enrolled sites, and camps. Open sites operate in an area where at least half of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals (referred to as \u201carea eligible\u201d), according to data from entities such as schools or the U.S. Census Bureau. Children are generally eligible for free or reduced-price school meals if their households have incomes at or below 185 percent of federal poverty guidelines. At open sites, meals are made available to all children in the area, and all meals served that meet program requirements are reimbursable. Closed enrolled sites, on the other hand, are open only to enrolled children, as opposed to the community at large. At closed enrolled sites, meals served to all children in attendance are reimbursable as long as at least half of the enrolled children are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch. Unlike other types of sites, camps are reimbursed only for meals served to children who have been individually determined to be eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. SFSP meals must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for federal reimbursement; for example, the meals must be served and consumed on-site at an approved site. Federal reimbursements for summer meals are provided for each breakfast, lunch, supper, or snack served to an eligible child at an eligible site that also meets federal requirements for menu components, scheduled meal times, and nutrition. For example, to meet nutritional requirements, a lunch or a supper must, at a minimum, include four components: 2 ounces of meat or a comparable serving of a meat alternate, 3/4 cup of fruits and/or vegetables (at least two kinds), a slice of bread or a comparable serving of another grain, and a cup of milk. In 2017, the federal reimbursement rate was $3.83 or $3.77 for each eligible SFSP lunch or supper served, depending on the type of meal site. Each site may serve up to two meals or one meal and one snack per day. Some flexibilities are available to FNS in implementing the SFSP program, under its waiver and demonstration authorities. Specifically, the National School Lunch Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to waive, upon request of a state or eligible service provider, certain program requirements established under the National School Lunch Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended, including some for the SFSP. In order to grant a waiver request, the Secretary must determine that the waiver would facilitate the state or service provider\u2019s ability to carry out the purpose of the program, and that the waiver will not increase the overall cost of the program to the federal government, among other things. In the event a waiver request is submitted, the Secretary is required to act promptly and state in writing whether the waiver request is granted or denied, and why. The Secretary is also required to periodically review the performance of waiver recipients, and submit an annual report to Congress summarizing the use of waivers and their effectiveness, among other details. In addition to this waiver authority, the Secretary is also authorized to carry out demonstration projects to develop and test methods of providing access to summer meals for low-income children in urban and rural areas, to reduce or eliminate the food insecurity and hunger of low-income children and improve their nutritional status. The Secretary is required to provide for an independent evaluation of the demonstration projects carried out under this authority, and submit an annual report to Congress on the status of each project and the results of the evaluations. The total number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer\u2014 one indicator of program participation\u2014increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32 percent, according to our analysis of FNS data. The number of SFSP meals served has generally increased from year to year over this 10-year period. Most recently, meals decreased by 6 percent from 156 million meals in summer 2015 to 149 million meals in summer 2016, according to our analysis of FNS data (see fig. 2). Factors that may have affected year-to-year fluctuations include changes in funding for summer programs, sponsor participation, weather, and the number of weekdays available for sites to serve meals within a given summer, according to FNS and state agency officials we interviewed. For example, state agency officials in one of the three selected states we visited said they believe that reductions in state and local funding for summer programs that also provide meals, and turnover of sponsors, including losing one of the state\u2019s largest sponsors in a recent summer, affected the total number of SFSP meals served in their state in 2016. According to our analysis of FNS data, SFSP lunches served in the summer months increased by over 17 million from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016, accounting for almost half of the total increase in the number of SFSP meals served in that period. However, when comparing across each of the meal types, supper and breakfast had the largest percentage increases over the 10-year period, 50 and 48 percent, respectively (see table 1). In comparison, the number of SFSP lunches served increased by 26 percent from fiscal years 2007 through fiscal year 2016. From fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016, there were increases in the numbers of meals served in both SFSP and NSLP, the largest child nutrition assistance program. Specifically, SFSP lunches served in July increased from 32 million to 40 million, or 24 percent, from fiscal year 2007 to 2016, and NSLP lunches served in March increased from 328 million to 376 million meals, or 15 percent, according to our analysis of FNS data. Although the programs generally serve similar populations, different factors likely affected the number of meals served by each program, in part because NSLP serves children in schools during the school year and SFSP serves children in a variety of settings during the summer months. Although states report the actual number of SFSP meals served to FNS, they estimate the number of children participating in SFSP, and information obtained from our state survey and FNS indicate that these participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently. FNS instructs state agencies on how to calculate a statewide estimate of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP, referred to as average daily attendance (ADA), using sponsor-reported information on the number of meals served and days of operation in July of each year. However, states\u2019 methods for calculating ADA have differed from state to state and from year to year, according to our review of states\u2019 survey responses and FNS documents. For example, although FNS directed states to include the number of meals served in each site\u2019s primary meal service\u2014 which may or may not be lunch\u2014some states, according to our survey and FNS data, were calculating ADA using only meals served at lunch. FNS officials told us that these states were therefore not following the agency\u2019s instructions. Further, some states have changed their methods for calculating ADA over time\u2014five states reported in our survey that the method they used to calculate ADA in fiscal year 2016 differed from the one they used previously. While FNS clarified its instructions in May 2017 to help improve the consistency of states\u2019 ADA calculations moving forward, ADA remains an unreliable estimate of children\u2019s daily participation in SFSP for at least two reasons, according to our analysis. (See sidebar for the revised ADA calculation instructions.) First, ADA is based on summary data that does not account for existing variation in site days of operation, and second, it is based on July data, which does not reflect the month with the greatest number of meals served in every state. According to our analysis, ADA is an unreliable estimate of children\u2019s participation in SFSP because it currently does not account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves meals to children. Specifically, because FNS\u2019s instructions indicate that sites\u2019 ADAs are to be combined to provide a statewide ADA estimate, differences in the number of days of meal service are disregarded. As a result, ADA does not reflect the average number of children served SFSP meals daily throughout the month. Our analysis of site-level data from one of the selected states illustrates this limitation. In this state, multiple sites reported an ADA of 60 for July, yet two of those sites served meals to children on only 1 day of the month and another site served meals to children on 20 days. Although 120 children were served SFSP meals only 1 day in July across two of these sites, the combined ADA across all three sites, which we calculated following FNS\u2019s instructions, inaccurately suggests an average of 180 children were participating in SFSP at these sites on a daily basis in July. According to our analysis, ADA is also an unreliable estimate of children\u2019s participation in SFSP because it currently does not account for state variation in the month with the greatest number of SFSP meals served, potentially leading to an underestimate. According to FNS officials, the agency instructs states to calculate ADA for July because officials identified this as the month with the largest number of meals served nationwide. However, because of reasons such as state variations in school calendars, July is not the month with the largest number of meals served in every state. In one of the selected states, Arizona, using July to calculate ADA cuts the estimate almost in half. Specifically, we followed FNS\u2019s instructions and calculated that Arizona\u2019s ADA was 14,987 in July 2016 compared to 26,772 in June 2016. Nationwide, in summer 2016, 26 states served more SFSP meals in June or August than in July, according to our analysis of FNS data. However, without site level data on meals served and operating days, the extent to which these states had higher ADAs in June or August as compared to July is unknown. In its May 2017 memo to states revising the ADA calculation instructions, FNS said that it is critical that the agency\u2019s means of estimating children\u2019s participation in the SFSP is as accurate as possible because it helps inform program implementation at the national level and facilitates strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. In addition, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that agencies should maintain quality data and process it into quality information that is shared with stakeholders to help achieve agency goals. Although FNS has also collected information on other data that states collect on the SFSP, the agency has not yet used this information to help improve its estimate of children\u2019s participation in the program. In 2015, FNS published a Request for Information, asking whether states or sponsors collect any SFSP data that are not reported to FNS. While FNS received responses from only 15 states, these responses suggest that some states collect additional data, such as site-level data that may allow for an improved estimate of children\u2019s SFSP participation, potentially addressing the issues we found in our analysis. In response to the information FNS received, they followed up with up to 9 of the 15 states in 2016 and 2017 to explore the feasibility of collecting additional data and improving estimates of children\u2019s participation. Although they took these steps, FNS officials told us they are cognizant of the burden on states and site operators that would be associated with additional reporting requirements. At this time, the agency has not taken further action to improve the estimate, such as addressing the reliability issues caused by variation in the number of operating days of meal sites and in the months with the greatest number of meals served by state. As a result, FNS\u2019s understanding of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP remains limited, which impairs its ability to both inform program implementation and facilitate strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. Other federal programs that operate solely in the summer, as well as those operating year-round, help feed low-income children in the summer months. These programs include the NSLP Seamless Summer Option, which provides nutrition assistance benefits solely in the summer, and several federal programs that operate year-round. In July 2016, in addition to the 70 million meals provided through the SFSP, 26 million meals were provided to low-income children through school food authorities participating in the NSLP\u2019s Seamless Summer Option, according to FNS data. The Seamless Summer Option was established in 2004, and according to FNS, streamlines administrative requirements to encourage school food authorities providing free or reduced-price meals during the school year under the NSLP and SBP to continue providing meals to low-income children when school is not in session. For example, officials from a national organization involved in summer meals told us the Seamless Summer Option makes it easier for school food authorities to provide summer meals because they continue working with the same state agency, reporting the same information to the state, and operating without having to transition to a separate program. Nonetheless, school food authorities can choose to provide free summer meals to children through either the SFSP or Seamless Summer Option, and the majority of states (34) reported in our survey that a greater proportion of school food authorities participated in the SFSP than the Seamless Summer Option in summer 2016. According to FNS and selected state officials, this may be related to the generally lower meal reimbursement rates school food authorities participating in the Seamless Summer Option receive compared to the rates received by those participating in the SFSP. In summer 2016, the Seamless Summer Option added to the geographic availability of summer meal sites in two of the three states we visited as part of our review. School food authorities provided summer meals through the Seamless Summer Option in Arizona and Illinois, but not in Massachusetts, based on our analysis of data provided by these states. In Arizona and Illinois, school food authorities participating in the Seamless Summer Option added 643 and 298 summer meal sites, respectively, in the month with the largest number of SFSP meals served in each state (see fig. 3). In addition, some of the Seamless Summer Option sites in these two states provided meals to children in areas where there were no SFSP sites. For example, Seamless Summer Option sites provided meals in areas near the northeastern and southwestern corners of Arizona that lacked nearby SFSP sites. In addition to the SFSP and the Seamless Summer Option, the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) demonstration provided nutrition assistance benefits to 209,000 low-income children in summer 2016 in select areas across 6 states and 2 Indian Tribal Organizations, according to FNS officials. Since the summer of 2011, Summer EBT benefits have been provided to eligible households on an electronic benefits transfer card, which households use to purchase eligible foods at authorized retailers. Specifically, the demonstration has provided monthly benefits of $30 or $60 per eligible child to households with children in areas with a perceived high level of need, based on the demonstration grantees\u2019 assessments of the percentage of children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals and the availability of the SFSP. Consistent with this, three of the states that participated in Summer EBT in 2016 reported through our survey that these benefits helped children who were unable to access summer meals through the SFSP or the Seamless Summer Option. Further, according to an FNS- funded evaluation, Summer EBT improved food security among low- income children who participated in the demonstration. Specifically, the evaluation found the receipt of these benefits reduced the number of children in the demonstration experiencing very low food security between 2011 and 2013 by one-third. Some low-income children also receive nutrition assistance in the summer through federal programs that operate year-round. According to FNS data, in June 2016, 5.8 million infants and children participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and 3 million children participated in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). In addition, an average of 19.2 million children participated each month in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in fiscal year 2016, according to FNS data. These benefits are provided year-round, including when school is in session and children may also be eligible to receive school meals. In our previous work on federal domestic food assistance programs, we reported that no one program alone is intended to meet a household\u2019s full nutritional needs. At that time, several officials and providers told us that the variety of food assistance programs offers eligible individuals and households different types of assistance and can help households fill the gaps and address the specific needs of individual members. For example, a mother with two children may rely on SNAP for her household\u2019s basic groceries, the NSLP to feed a school-age child during the school year, and WIC to obtain supplemental foods for herself and an infant. Some low-income children also receive summer meals through nonfederal programs, according to our state survey and interviews with organizations involved in summer meals. Twenty-seven states reported in our survey that they were aware of other state- or non-state-funded programs that provided children of low-income households with meals in their states during the summer months. According to our analysis of state survey responses, local faith-based organizations and foodbanks were the most common types of entities operating these types of programs. Similarly, officials from FNS and two regional organizations we interviewed said they were aware of children receiving summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith- based and other community organizations. In addition, SFSP site operators at 6 of the 30 meal sites we visited in the selected states told us nearby foodbanks and faith-based organizations may also be providing children with free meals to some extent. For example, one of the meal sites we visited was operated by a foodbank that, in addition to the SFSP, provided food boxes to those in need and distributed food to other local community organizations to provide to persons in need of immediate assistance, including families with children. Although FNS and the majority of states do not collect data on nonfederal programs, results from our state survey and interviews with SFSP providers and organizations involved in summer meals indicate the reach of nonfederal programs is limited. In our survey, states reported that the geographic coverage of these nonfederal programs varied by state, with 11 states indicating that they operated in some portions of the state\u2014the most common state response. In addition, 16 states reported that they were not aware of any nonfederal programs providing summer meals to children in their state (see fig. 4). Similarly, SFSP site operators at 24 of the 30 meal sites we visited were unaware of nonfederal programs providing meals to children in the areas in which they operated. In addition, officials from several national organizations involved in summer meals told us children have very few options for receiving summer meals beyond the federal summer meals programs. Specifically, officials from one national organization explained that food is often a significant part of the cost of a summer activity program for children and suggested that is one reason why organizations choose to participate in the SFSP. Although the SFSP provides for federal reimbursement of eligible meals and certain administrative and operating costs, nonfederal programs that provide children with summer meals may choose not to participate in the SFSP for several reasons, according to officials we interviewed from several organizations involved in summer meals. For example, some nonfederal program providers may not participate in the SFSP because they are unaware the program exists. Additionally, some nonfederal program providers may be aware of the SFSP, but choose not to participate because they do not want to follow certain program requirements, such as the nutrition or meal pattern standards. In addition, some providers may not participate in the program because they do not think they can handle certain aspects of the administrative workload associated with the SFSP. For example, a state official we interviewed told us the administrative workload associated with the SFSP can be particularly challenging, especially for smaller sponsors. Similarly, officials from a regional organization involved in summer meals told us one of the providers they work with who operated 10 meal sites chose to leave the SFSP because the paperwork required to operate the sites was too administratively burdensome for their volunteer site operators. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and administration, though federal, state, and local entities have taken steps to improve these areas. Half or more of states reported in our survey that SFSP issues related to meal site availability, such as in rural areas, increasing children\u2019s participation, and program administration were moderately to extremely challenging (see fig. 5). Overall, 41 states reported facing at least one challenge with the SFSP, while 9 reported facing none. Availability of transportation, low population density, and limited meal sites pose challenges for SFSP in rural areas, according to states we surveyed, selected national organizations, and state and local officials in the three selected states we visited. More than two-thirds of states in our survey reported they faced a moderate to extreme challenge with limited options in rural areas to transport children to summer meal sites (37), as well as with the distance to summer meal sites in rural areas resulting in low child turnout that affects the financial viability of site sponsorship (36). As officials from one national organization explained, it may not be cost- effective for sponsors to operate in remote or rural areas if there are not enough meal sites or children participating in the program. Similarly, a sponsor in one of the selected states indicated that there are large parts of the state where the distances between meal sites are substantial, and travel between them takes several hours. An official from one of the selected states said transportation challenges can lead to underserved rural areas, including Indian reservations. Of the three states we reviewed, each had rural areas with few or no federally funded meal sites in summer 2016. However, a majority of the children in some of those areas were eligible for free or reduced price school meals, according to Census data provided by FNS, and would therefore be \u201carea eligible\u201d for the purposes of SFSP. For example, as shown in figure 6, \u201carea eligible\u201d locations in rural western parts of Arizona did not have any SFSP or Seamless Summer Option meals sites in June 2016, the month with the greatest number of summer meals served in that state. States and SFSP providers have responded to challenges with meal sites in rural areas by using other meal delivery approaches\u2014efforts that FNS has supported through information sharing and grants. For example, according to one national organization involved in summer meals, some SFSP providers offer vans or buses to transport children to meal sites or partner with local bus authorities to give children free rides to meal sites. Instead of transporting children to sites, other sponsors transport meals to children through mobile meal delivery, an alternative summer meal model used in 48 states according to our survey. In this model, sponsors deliver meals by bus, using a route with state-approved stops in a community, and children consume the meal at the stop under a supervised setting. According to FNS officials and representatives from national organizations, this approach can be particularly helpful for providing summer meals to children in rural areas. State officials in two selected states told us they use mobile meal delivery to help fill gaps in meal service and help children overcome the lack of transportation or resources in their community. To serve children in very remote areas with limited resources, a sponsor in one of the selected states reported piloting a model involving delivering frozen meals every other week to such areas and supplying equipment, such as freezers and microwaves, to support meal service. To help sponsors address challenges related to meal sites in rural areas, FNS has shared information on alternative delivery models through its SFSP toolkit and webinars and has also provided related grant funding. For example, in summer 2011 and 2012, FNS funded the Meal Delivery demonstration project to provide meals to children in rural areas where low population density, long distances, and transportation issues made it difficult for children to get to SFSP sites, making site and sponsor operation financially unsustainable. The demonstration project funded meals to children in rural areas of Delaware, Massachusetts, and New York, providing food delivery to homes or drop-off sites near homes of eligible children. More than half the states (30) in our survey reported they faced a moderate to extreme challenge reaching low-income children in communities that are not area eligible. Areas in which fewer than 50 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals during the school year are not eligible to have open summer meal sites at which all children who come to the site can receive a free meal. As a result, some children who are eligible for free and reduced-price meals during the school year do not have open summer meal sites located in close proximity to their residences, according to several national organization officials and SFSP providers. Eligible children in these areas may instead be limited to other types of SFSP sites, such as closed enrolled summer meal sites, or nonfederal programs providing meals, if available. For example, in one of the selected states, a sponsor of SFSP sites funded meals without federal support at one site that they operated as an open site in order to serve low-income children residing in low-income housing. These children did not otherwise have access to a federally funded summer meals site, according to these officials, because the broader area was part of a school district that had a greater than 50 percent proportion of children from higher-income families. Recognizing that some children may reside in an area that is not area eligible but is immediately adjacent to such an area, FNS has allowed additional flexibility in establishing area eligibility for open meal sites. Specifically, in 2014 and 2016 policy memos, FNS expanded the ways in which states and sponsors can use Census data to establish area eligibility. For example, FNS has allowed states and sponsors to average Census data across adjacent geographic areas to determine area eligibility. FNS noted that these additional flexibilities help ensure meal sites can be located in more areas in which poor economic conditions exist. Nearly all states (50) reported in our survey that the availability of meal sites throughout the summer months was a factor critical to the success of the SFSP, yet more than half the states (27) also reported they faced a moderate to extreme challenge with limited meal site days of operation. Nineteen of the 40 states that provided information about site days of operation reported 1 day as the shortest length of operation for SFSP sites in their state in fiscal year 2016. Limited meal site days of operation was a significant challenge in one of the three selected states we visited, as almost one-quarter of sites operated for only 1 to 2 weeks across a 2-month period in summer 2016, and an additional half of sites operated for 3 to 4 weeks across that same period, according to our analysis of state data. In contrast, in the other two selected states, the majority of sites (64 and 76 percent, respectively) operated for 5 or more weeks during a 2-month period. SFSP sites may have limited days of operation for various reasons, such as constraints with program administration and costs, according to interviews with a national organization official and a sponsor in one of the selected states. Some SFSP providers and national organizations involved in summer meals have responded to these challenges by working to extend the days of operation of meal sites\u2014efforts that FNS has supported through related grant funding. Officials from one meal site located at a school in one of the selected states told us that 2017 was the first year the site stayed open an additional 4 weeks after summer school classes ended in an effort to expand participation, an extension made possible through support from an experienced sponsor. In addition, officials from a national organization involved in sponsoring summer meals told us they encourage their local sites to operate in August\u2014a month where there are generally fewer summer meal service offerings\u2014to meet children\u2019s needs. At the federal level, under its demonstration authority, FNS funded the Extending Length of Operation Incentive project, a grant which provided an additional 50-cent reimbursement for all lunch meals served at sites in Arkansas in 2010 that offered meals for 40 or more days. Two-thirds of states (34) reported through our survey that they also faced a moderate to extreme challenge with a lack of awareness of summer meal sites among children and families, a challenge also mentioned by SFSP providers in the selected states. Meal site operators in one selected state noted that making families aware that all children may receive a meal for free at open sites can be a challenge. For example, one sponsor operating a meal site in a school said the perception among some is that the meal program is only for children attending summer school, and not for others in the community. Although that site had outside banners and advertising to help address that misperception, another SFSP provider explained that having sufficient funds to market the SFSP and increase awareness among families is also a challenge. To address these challenges, state agencies, some SFSP providers, and FNS have taken steps to help promote awareness of the SFSP. For example, nearly all states (47) reported in our survey that they have increased their outreach efforts for the SFSP in the last 5 years. More than half of states (36) also reported increases in overall SFSP participation during that time, which they believe were related to their outreach efforts. The majority of states in our survey reported conducting outreach on the SFSP to groups including children, parents and guardians, and schools, among others, using methods such as flyers, email, newspapers, and social media (see fig. 7). Further, state agency officials and sponsors in the selected states reported that they have developed partnerships with state and local advocacy groups and community leaders, among others, to promote the SFSP. For example, one state agency official said they partner with local advocacy organizations to field calls from parents seeking information about summer meal sites through their hunger hotline. FNS has promoted the use of such partnerships, as well as traditional and social media, to raise awareness of the SFSP. In addition, FNS developed the Summer Meals Site Finder, an online mapping tool that provides information on summer meal sites nationwide. Attracting children of all ages to SFSP meal sites can also be a challenge, according to states and SFSP providers. More than half of the states (31) reported in our survey that they faced a moderate to extreme challenge with limited youth and teen participation at summer meal sites, and an official from a national organization involved in the SFSP explained that it is difficult to attract children to a meal site when the site is focused solely on food. Similarly, 46 states in our survey reported that providing age- appropriate programming and enrichment activities for children at summer meal sites is a factor critical to the success of the SFSP. However, some meal sites may lack the resources to add activities, according to some SFSP providers in the selected states as well as FNS and national organization officials. Attracting teens can be particularly challenging, in part because of meal service time periods, a lack of age- appropriate activities, and stigma, according to national organizations and providers we interviewed. For example, early morning meal sites generally attract younger kids as teens may be apt to sleep later in the summer, and teens may also perceive a stigma in participating in a free meal program and may face peer pressure not to eat. In addition, meal offerings at SFSP sites may also present challenges to teen participation. Specifically, because FNS bases minimum portion size requirements for meals on the needs of younger children, meals are not always adequate to meet the nutritional needs of teens, according to one sponsor we interviewed. Across the 30 meal sites in the 3 states we visited in summer 2016, we observed variety in the meals served during different meal services. (see fig. 8.) States and SFSP providers have collaborated with others and sought specific types of sites to help provide enrichment activities and attract certain age groups\u2014efforts that FNS has supported through information sharing and related grant funding. Sponsors in the selected states said they have focused on partnerships with groups such as those focused on youth development, churches, libraries, and police or fire departments, to offer age-appropriate activities for children (see fig. 9). For example, programs with local police departments, such as Cops N Kids in one selected state, or libraries in two selected states, provided meal services in combination with youth development or other enrichment activities. (See sidebar for highlights on the Cops N Kids program.) One national organization official said activities at SFSP sites can help take away the stigma around the program because children are not just there for the meal. Efforts to rebrand the SFSP as a community event where entire families can participate at the meal site also can have this effect, which is why some sponsors in the selected states said they partnered with foodbanks to donate meals for adults. In addition, a sponsor in one selected state told us they adjusted their meal offerings to match the needs of children of different age groups, for example, by serving meals to younger children earlier in the day and meals to teens later in the day. To support participation from children of all ages, FNS has shared information on age-appropriate activities through its SFSP toolkit and provided related grant funding. For example, in 2010, FNS funded the Activity Incentive demonstration project, in which sponsors in Mississippi were provided with mini-grants to increase enrichment and recreational activities, such as education, tutoring, sports and games, arts and other activities, to draw children to meal sites. More than half the states reported in our survey that they faced a moderate to extreme challenge with limited state agency staffing (27), a limited amount of federal funding for SFSP administration (27), as well as ensuring sponsor participation to meet needs (28). In addition, 28 states reported in our survey that they faced a moderate to extreme challenge with sponsors not following program requirements. Limited staffing can affect a state agency\u2019s ability to conduct efforts aimed at increasing participation, identifying potential sponsors, and reviewing and monitoring sponsors, according to national organization and state officials we interviewed. For example, increases in sponsors and sites requires additional staff and time to conduct pre-approval visits, sponsor and site reviews, vendor reviews, and technical assistance visits, which directly affects the amount of funding needed to support staff salaries and travel reimbursement, according to one state in our survey. However, because the SFSP administrative funds FNS provides to states are based on the number of meals served in the previous year, increasing the number of staff to help increase SFSP participation is difficult, according to a national organization official we interviewed. States reported a moderate to extreme challenge with the following issues related to ensuring sponsor participation: a lack of sponsors to meet summer meal needs, a lack of awareness of the summer meal program among potential sponsors or sites, completing federal requirements for monitoring of SFSP sponsors, and identifying potential sponsors. State agencies responsible for administering the SFSP reported relying on other resources and partners to help with program administration\u2014 strategies that FNS has supported through information sharing and its online tools. As discussed earlier, all three selected state agencies we interviewed told us they partner with advocacy groups to help expand and conduct outreach on the SFSP. Additionally, more than half the states in our survey reported several factors\u2014which may ease the administrative burden on states\u2014as critical to the success of the SFSP, including partnerships with SFSP sponsors (49) and retaining sponsors and sites over multiple summers (51). To support states\u2019 use of alternative funding sources to help administer the SFSP, FNS has shared information on federal, state, and private funding and grant opportunities. FNS also developed the online Capacity Builder tool, which 35 states reported in our survey was moderately to extremely useful in identifying or confirming meal site eligibility in fiscal year 2017. Seventeen states reported in our survey that ensuring summer meal sites are in safe locations was moderately to very challenging, a challenge that some states and SFSP providers have taken steps to help address. State officials and SFSP providers in the selected states reported that when crime has occurred near a site, there are concerns about ensuring children\u2019s safety while they are consuming meals at the site, as well as the safety of site staff delivering meals. Some sponsors noted, in particular, parents\u2019 concerns for the safety of their children at meal sites in light of criminal activities in the surrounding area. To ensure children continue to have access to meals, some sponsors noted that in the event of an immediate threat at an outdoor meal site, site staff are sometimes able to bring children to a nearby indoor space instead. States and SFSP provider officials in two selected states told us they have also used other strategies, including partnerships with local law enforcement agencies, to help address safety concerns during the meal service and ensure children have access to meals. For example, national organizations involved in summer meals and sponsor officials in the selected states said they encourage partnerships with local police departments to use police escorts at meal sites or to follow mobile meal routes in situations where safety at the meal site is a concern. When violence or crime has occurred near a site, some states and SFSP sponsors have also sought flexibility from FNS with respect to the federal requirement that children consume summer meals on site, according to state and local officials. FNS has used its available authorities to grant some states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on site, such as when safety at the site is a concern; however, FNS has not clearly communicated to all states and sponsors the circumstances it considers when deciding whether to grant this flexibility. According to our review of letters FNS sent to multiple states approving their requests for this type of flexibility, the agency identified a consistent set of circumstances that needed to be met for it to grant this flexibility. These circumstances were described in the letters the agency sent to states and generally included verification that violent crime activities occurred within both a 6-block radius of the meal site and 72 hours prior to the meal service. FNS\u2019s letters to states indicate that when documentation was provided to the agency showing that these circumstances existed at a summer meals site on a particular day or days, meals consumed by children off site on those days were eligible for federal reimbursement. Although FNS has issued guidance on the general processes for requesting flexibility from program requirements under its waiver and demonstration authorities, these guidance documents do not detail the specific circumstances that the agency considers when deciding whether to grant flexibility from the on-site requirement due to safety concerns. FNS has communicated this information only in its responses to specific state and sponsor requests, and it has not communicated these circumstances more broadly to all states and sponsors. FNS officials explained that they review state and sponsor requests for flexibility due to safety concerns on a case-by-case basis. However, they also acknowledged that the set of circumstances used for approval of state and sponsor requests for flexibility, which we identified in their letters to states, has been used repeatedly. Further, states and sponsors reported challenges obtaining the specific data needed for approval of a site for this type of flexibility, hampering some providers\u2019 efforts to ensure safe delivery of meals. For example, state agency and sponsor officials in one selected state said obtaining the crime data needed to qualify for the flexibility can be an administrative burden on sponsors, and these data are not consistently available in a timely manner. According to state agency and sponsor officials in one of the selected states, daily crime statistics are not available in all areas, and while a sponsor can sometimes access current data on crime in a city, the most recent available data on crime in suburban areas are sometimes one year old. FNS is aware of state and local challenges obtaining the necessary crime data, according to our discussions with FNS officials. FNS officials acknowledged that while they have granted some state and sponsor requests to allow children to consume meals off site in certain areas where violence or crime has occurred, some sponsors were unable to implement the flexibility because they could not obtain the necessary crime data. To help achieve agency objectives and address related risks, the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that agencies should communicate key information to their internal and external stakeholders. Although FNS officials told us they do not have one set of circumstances under which they approve these requests, our review found only one set of circumstances under which this type of flexibility has been approved. However, FNS has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers in deciding whether to approve requests for flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on site in areas with violence or crime. Unless FNS shares this information with all states and sponsors, states and sponsors will likely continue to be challenged to use this flexibility, hindering its usefulness in ensuring safe summer meal delivery to children. In addition, FNS has issued reports to Congress evaluating some of its demonstration projects, as required under its statutory authorities, but the agency has not issued any such reports to Congress specifically on the use of flexibilities with respect to the on-site requirement in areas where safety is a concern. As previously discussed, the agency is required to annually submit certain reports to Congress regarding the use of waivers and evaluations of projects carried out under its demonstration authority. Furthermore, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should use quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate the entity\u2019s performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks. Yet, FNS has not evaluated nor reported on the use of waivers and demonstration projects in cases where safety was a concern. Although FNS requests reports from state agencies or sponsors that have received flexibility with summer meals delivery under FNS\u2019s demonstration and waiver authorities, FNS officials told us they have not assessed whether their use of these flexibilities to address safety issues has been effective in ensuring safe meal delivery. FNS officials told us that they have not evaluated or reported on these flexibilities, in part, because they have limited information on their outcomes. Without understanding the impact of its use of these flexibilities, neither FNS nor Congress knows whether these flexibilities are helping provide meals to children. In addition to the challenges with safety at meal sites, sponsors also sometimes face administrative challenges when participating in multiple child nutrition programs that are operated by different state agencies or divisions within the same agency, according to officials from national and regional organizations and sponsors we interviewed. For example, officials from national organizations involved in summer meals told us the management of each child nutrition program and processes related to applications, funding, and oversight are fragmented in many states. For example, a sponsor in one of the selected states told us aspects of the SFSP and CACFP sponsor applications are highly duplicative and estimated it took 42 hours last year to complete duplicative paperwork. Another sponsor that provides school meals during the school year told us they had to fill out 60 additional pages of paperwork to provide summer meals, which coupled with having a state contact for the SFSP that was different from the one they worked with for the NSLP, was a significant burden for them. Officials from one national organization told us a lack of interoperability of some state agencies\u2019 data systems has caused challenges and administrative burden for some sponsors. For example, in some states, different agencies oversee child nutrition programs, yet are unable to share data on sponsor approval, and therefore, sponsors are required to submit similar information to both, according to these officials. Duplicative paperwork can be particularly burdensome for some SFSP providers, as national organization officials and SFSP providers in the selected states said completing SFSP application paperwork can be especially challenging when a sponsor has staff shortages or no dedicated SFSP staff. Some selected states have worked with SFSP sponsors to help minimize the administrative burden. For example, state agency officials from one of the selected states said they have connected less-experienced sponsors to more-experienced sponsors in the community to help them with program administration. In one case, an experienced SFSP sponsor partnered with a small sponsor new to the program to help with SFSP administration, including helping them understand program rules and paperwork requirements. One SFSP sponsor also noted that their state agency took additional steps to ease administrative burden, such as making the forms for the CACFP more consistent with those for the SFSP and streamlining certain requirements for large and experienced sponsors, which the sponsor found helpful. At the federal level, FNS has established program and policy simplifications to help lessen the administrative burden on sponsors participating in multiple child nutrition programs, though the persistence of these challenges indicate that information about these simplifications has not reached all relevant state agencies. While FNS officials told us that some of the duplicative requirements may be a function of differences in statute, FNS provided guidance to states in 2011 and 2014 on simplified application procedures for institutions participating in CACFP that also wish to apply for SFSP. FNS noted in its guidance that in states where CACFP and SFSP are administered by different state agencies, state agencies are encouraged to work together to share information and streamline the application and agreement process as much as possible. FNS also addressed these simplifications in a state agency meeting in November 2017. Additionally, FNS provided guidance to states in 2012 on simplified application and review procedures for school food authorities participating in the NSLP that wish to also participate in the SFSP. Although FNS has shared this information with states in an attempt to make them aware of streamlining options, FNS officials noted that some states may choose not to implement them. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, as well as periodically evaluate the methods of communication to ensure communication is effective and appropriate. FNS\u2019s existing guidance addresses options for streamlining administrative requirements for sponsors participating in multiple child nutrition programs. However, information on program and policy simplifications available for sponsors participating in both NSLP and SFSP has not been shared with states recently, and challenges in this area persist, indicating this information has not reached all relevant state agencies. Without further efforts from FNS to disseminate information on current options for streamlining administrative requirements across child nutrition programs, overlapping and duplicative administrative requirements may limit children\u2019s access to meals by discouraging sponsor participation in child nutrition programs. The purpose of the SFSP is to continue to provide children in low-income areas with nutritious meals over the summer when school is no longer in session, and to that end, the program provided 149 million SFSP meals to children in fiscal year 2016. Although meals served are one indicator of participation, FNS\u2019s current estimates of children participating in SFSP are unreliable. Without additional understanding of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP, FNS lacks information critical for informing program implementation, strategic planning, and outreach. The majority of states nationwide and SFSP providers in the three states we visited reported experiencing a number of challenges with the SFSP, and FNS has taken important steps to address these challenges. Two key challenges identified by officials in the selected states and national organizations we interviewed are ensuring summer meal sites are in safe locations, and meeting administrative requirements when participating in multiple child nutrition programs. FNS has taken steps to address these challenges by providing flexibilities in how meals are delivered to children and streamlining options for those providers participating in more than one child nutrition program. However, a lack of clarity concerning the circumstances under which FNS grants flexibilities in areas of violence and crime, and a lack of information on its use of these flexibilities and their impact on program administration, hinder efforts to ensure program goals are met. Furthermore, absent a reminder to states regarding existing options for streamlining administration across multiple nutrition programs, some providers may continue to be discouraged from participating in these programs due to duplicative and burdensome administrative requirements, which may ultimately limit the provision of nutritious meals to children. We are making the following four recommendations to FNS: The Administrator of FNS should improve its estimate of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP by focusing on addressing, at a minimum, data reliability issues caused by variations in the number of operating days of meal sites and in the months in which states see the greatest number of meals served. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of FNS should communicate to all SFSP stakeholders the circumstances it considers in approving requests for flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume SFSP meals on-site in areas that have experienced crime and violence, taking into account the feasibility of accessing data needed for approval, to ensure safe delivery of meals to children. (Recommendation 2) The Administrator of FNS should evaluate and annually report to Congress, as required by statute, on its use of waivers and demonstration projects to grant states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume SFSP meals on-site in areas experiencing crime or violence, to improve its understanding of the use and impact of granting these flexibilities on meeting program goals. (Recommendation 3) The Administrator of FNS should disseminate information about existing flexibilities available to state agencies to streamline administrative requirements for sponsors participating in the SFSP and other child nutrition programs to help lessen the administrative burden. For example, FNS could re-distribute existing guidance to state agencies that explains available flexibilities and encourage information sharing. (Recommendation 4) We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of the USDA for review and comment. FNS officials provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. In addition, in oral comments, FNS officials, including the Deputy Administrator for Child Nutrition Programs, generally agreed with the recommendations in the report. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of the USDA and interested congressional committees. The report will also be available at no charge on the GAO website at www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or larink@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. This appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing three research objectives: (1) What is known about participation in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and how has it changed in the last 10 years? (2) What other programs help feed low-income children over the summer? and (3) What challenges exist, if any, in providing summer meals to children, and to what extent does the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) provide assistance to states and sponsors to address these challenges? In addition to the methods we discuss below, to address all three research objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed FNS officials in its headquarters and seven regional offices; and interviewed a broad range of regional and nationwide organizations involved in the SFSP. In addition, we coordinated with officials in USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General on their ongoing work in this area. To address our first objective about participation in the SFSP, we analyzed FNS data on meals served for fiscal years 2007 through 2016. Specifically, we analyzed the total number of meals served nationwide through the SFSP from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016. Each month, states report to FNS the number of meals served by meal type (breakfast, lunch, snack, and supper) and the number of meals served by meal and sponsor type (e.g., government, nonprofit, etc.) using the FNS- 418 form. To add context on these trends, we also analyzed and compared the number of SFSP lunches served in July with the number of free and reduced-price lunches served to children in March through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the largest child nutrition assistance program, from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016. Each month, states report to FNS the number of meals served through the NSLP using the FNS-10 form. To assess the reliability of SFSP and NSLP data, we (1) performed electronic testing of relevant data elements, (2) reviewed existing information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. Electronic testing included, but was not limited to, checks for missing data elements, duplicative records, and values outside a designated range or valid time period. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to identify the number of SFSP meals served and assess change over time. To further examine what is known about participation in the SFSP, we also reviewed FNS\u2019s data on estimates of children\u2019s participation in the program and determined that these estimates have been calculated inconsistently and are unreliable. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed documentation about the estimates, interviewed FNS officials, and asked states about the estimate calculation in our survey. As described in our findings, FNS does not collect data on the number of children participating in the SFSP. Instead, FNS relies on states\u2019 estimates of children\u2019s participation, which are based on other data reported by sponsors, such as the number of meals served and meal service days in July. To address our second objective about other programs that help feed children in the summer, we reviewed FNS\u2019s estimate of the number of meals served through the NSLP\u2019s Seamless Summer Option in fiscal year 2016. FNS does not collect data on the number of meals served through the Seamless Summer Option. Instead, FNS annually estimates the number of Seamless Summer Option meals served nationally by aggregating the number of free and reduced-price breakfasts, lunches, and snacks served through the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and NSLP in July. As previously noted, states report these data monthly to FNS. Although FNS does not know the actual number of meals served through the Seamless Summer Option, agency officials told us they believe the number of summer meals provided through the NSLP is small relative to the number of meals served through the Seamless Summer Option during the summer months. They noted that their use of July NSLP data to estimate the Seamless Summer Option meals likely overestimates the number of these meals for July and underestimates the number of these meals for the entire summer. To assess the reliability of the July NSLP data, we (1) performed electronic testing of relevant data elements, (2) reviewed existing information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. Electronic testing included, but was not limited to, checking for missing data and data that fell outside of a reasonable range or date for the specific time period (July). We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to describe the number of meals served. In addition to the data FNS requires states to report, some states collect summer meals data at the meal site level and we used such data from the three selected states to address all three objectives. For objective one, to examine the number of meals served and days of operation at each summer meals site, we analyzed site-level data for 2 months from summer 2016, including the month with the largest number of SFSP meals served in each selected state: Arizona (June and July 2016), Illinois (July and August 2016), and Massachusetts (July and August 2016). Each state also provided us with data on the number and types of meals served at each SFSP site, the site location, and the duration of time each site operated over the summer. Using the data provided by the states, we calculated the average daily attendance (ADA) for each meal site based on FNS\u2019s instructions and examined the variation in ADA across sites and months. For our second objective on other programs, these selected states provided similar site level data for the state\u2019s Seamless Summer Option sites, if applicable. We assessed the reliability of these data by (1) performing electronic testing of relevant data elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For both our second objective on other programs and third objective about challenges in providing summer meals to children, we also examined meal site availability in the three selected states by mapping the locations of meal sites. On the maps, we included fiscal year 2016 area eligibility data from FNS\u2019s Capacity Builder mapping tool, as provided by FNS. The site area eligibility data from FNS\u2019s Capacity Builder is based on the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of children ages 0-12 and 0-18 eligible for free and reduced-price meals by Census block group and tract. According to FNS officials, FNS obtains 5-Year ACS estimates annually from the U.S. Census Bureau and updates its site area eligibility in the Capacity Builder accordingly. For fiscal year 2016, FNS used 2009- 2013 ACS data to identify and include site area eligibility in its Capacity Builder. To help inform all of our research objectives, we conducted a survey of the state agencies that oversee the SFSP in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. We administered our web-based survey between August and October 2017 and received 100 percent response rate. The survey included questions about participation in the SFSP, factors critical to the overall success of the SFSP, outreach efforts, federal technical assistance, barriers and challenges in providing summer meals, alternative summer feeding models, the NSLP\u2019s Seamless Summer Option and the federal Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children demonstration, and nonfederal programs that provide children of low- income households with meals during the summer months. The survey also requested data on SFSP sites participating in the program in fiscal year 2016 and the method state agencies used to calculate ADA in SFSP on the FNS-418 form in fiscal year 2016. Because this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce nonsampling errors, such as variations in how respondents interpret questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses. We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors, including pretesting draft instruments and using a web-based administration system. Specifically, during survey development, we pretested draft instruments with SFSP staff from four states (Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Dakota) in May 2017. We selected the pretest states based on information provided by officials from FNS\u2019s regional offices and national organizations involved in summer meals about state administration of summer meals programs, with the goal of selecting a group of states with varied experiences. In the pretests, we were generally interested in the clarity, precision, and objectivity of the questions, as well as the flow and layout of the survey. For example, we wanted to ensure definitions used in the surveys were clear and known to the respondents, categories provided in close-ended questions were complete and exclusive, and the ordering of survey sections and the questions within each section were appropriate. We revised the final survey based on pretest results. Another step we took to minimize nonsampling errors was using a web-based survey. Allowing respondents to enter their responses directly into an electronic instrument created a record for each respondent in a data file and eliminated the need for and the errors associated with a manual data entry process. We did not fully validate specific information that states reported through our survey. To help inform all of our objectives and gather information about the SFSP directly at the local-level, we conducted 30 site visits in three states: Arizona (12 sites), Illinois (8 sites), and Massachusetts (10 sites) between June and July 2017, and interviewed organizations involved with the SFSP in each site visit state. We used U.S. Census Bureau data to select states and local areas within those states based on a high proportion of children in poverty, a mix of urban and rural locations, as well as a mix of sponsor and site type and diverse locations. We visited a wide variety of site locations including, but not limited to, schools, parks, community recreation areas, and libraries. At each SFSP site, we gathered information on local level factors related to SFSP participation and administration by interviewing the organization sponsoring the site, the site operators and staff, and those participating at the site using semi-structured questions. While interviewing SFSP sponsor organizations, we collected information on the sponsors\u2019 roles in the SFSP, characteristics of the sites the organizations sponsored, outreach efforts, any challenges or barriers to SFSP administration and any efforts to address such challenges, relationships with the state agencies that administer the SFSP, relationships with FNS (national and regional offices), and the availability of nonfederally funded programs that provide meals to low-income children over the summer. During the interviews with site operators and staff, we collected information about site operation (e.g., site operating days, meals offered, etc.), any challenges to providing SFSP meals to children and any efforts to address such challenges, outreach efforts, and the proximity of the next closest meal site. The information we collected from those participating at the sites included their perspectives on the SFSP food, site food consumption habits, ease of travel to the site, and access to other SFSP sites. At each site, we made observations as to how the food was provided to the children, food consumption and waste, the approximate age range of the children being served, and availability of programs or activities (e.g., recreational sports). Using semi-structured questions, we also interviewed the state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in the site visit states to gather further information on how the SFSP is administered in each state, statewide participation in the program, related data collection activities, any challenges to administering the program and any efforts to address such challenges, related outreach efforts, alternative meal delivery models being employed by SFSP sponsors, FNS guidance or technical assistance, and the availability of nonfederally funded programs that provide meals to low-income children over the summer. For states that indicated there were other challenge(s), we provided an open-ended question that requested a description of the challenge(s) and 14 states provided descriptions of other challenges, not shown here. For states that indicated there were other challenge(s), we provided an open-ended question that requested a description of the challenge(s) and 8 states provided descriptions of other challenges, not shown here.

                "The SFSP, a federal nutrition assistance program, is intended to provide food to children in low-income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation. In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."

            "context": "Grade-crossing safety has improved significantly since 1975, but since 2009, the number of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings has plateaued (see fig. 1). The yearly number of grade-crossing crashes declined from 12,126 in 1975 to 2,117 in 2017. In that time frame, fatalities dropped from 917 to 273. The most significant reductions in grade-crossing crashes and fatalities were achieved from 1975 to 1985, when states closed or improved the most dangerous crossings. Grade- crossing safety continued to improve until the mid-2000s, though at a slower rate. Since 2009, the number of grade-crossing crashes and fatalities remains at around 2,100 crashes and 250 fatalities a year. These fatalities typically make up less than one percent of all highway- related fatalities. The decrease in crashes and fatalities occurred as the volume of train and highway traffic generally increased over the years. FRA expects the traffic volumes to continue to increase and has expressed concern that grade-crossing crashes and fatalities may also increase. As a set-aside portion of FHWA\u2019s much larger Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), the Section 130 Program provides funds to state DOTs for the elimination of hazards at highway-rail grade crossings. States determine what improvements need to be made at grade crossings. FHWA has oversight responsibilities regarding the use of federal funds as part of its administration of federal-aid highway programs and funding, including HSIP funds. FHWA uses a statutory formula to distribute to states Section 130 Program funds, which averaged $235 million per year during the last 10 years (fiscal years 2009 through 2018). Section 130 Program projects are funded at a 90 percent federal share, with the state or the roadway authority funding the remaining 10 percent. States have 4 years to obligate their program funds before they expire, meaning that in any given fiscal year, states can obligate funds appropriated in that year as well as any unobligated funds from the previous 3 fiscal years. In addition, states may choose to combine funds from multiple years to fund relatively expensive projects. The Section 130 Program\u2019s requirements direct states to establish an implementation schedule for grade-crossing-safety improvement projects that, at a minimum, include warning signs for all public grade crossings. Grade crossings are generally categorized as \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d depending on the type of traffic control devices that are present. As of July 2018, according to FRA\u2019s National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory, there were approximately 68,000 public grade crossings with electronic, or active, traffic control devices in the United States. Another approximately 58,000 public grade crossings have passive traffic-control devices, which include signs and supplementary pavement markings. The requirements also specify that at least 50 percent of Section 130 Program funding must be dedicated to the installation of protective devices at grade crossings, including traffic control devices. States can use remaining program funds for any hazard elimination project. States may also use program funds to improve warning signs and pavement markings or to improve the way the roadway aligns with the tracks (e.g., to ensure low-clearance vehicles do not get stuck on the tracks). In addition, states can use up to 2 percent of the funds to improve their grade-crossing inventories and to collect and analyze data. See figure 2 for examples of the types of projects eligible for Section 130 Program funds and graphical depictions of grade crossings before and after safety improvements have been made. FHWA and FRA are the primary agencies responsible for safety at grade crossings, and they both play key\u2014yet distinct\u2014roles. FHWA oversees the Section 130 Program and monitors states\u2019 uses of program funds through 52 division offices located in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and through headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. In addition, FHWA\u2019s division staff reviews states\u2019 processes for prioritizing and selecting grade-crossing-safety improvement projects. FHWA does not evaluate the appropriateness of individual grade-crossing projects, but instead helps states determine that projects meet program eligibility requirements. Division staff assists in the implementation of Section 130 Program state-administered projects, and they may participate in state- DOT-led, on-site reviews of grade crossings under consideration for Section 130 Program projects. FHWA headquarters staff is responsible for FHWA-wide initiatives, such as working with stakeholders to establish standards for traffic control devices and systems at grade crossings and for engineering oversight of state-administered safety improvement projects. FRA provides safety oversight of both freight and passenger railroads by: collecting and analyzing data; issuing and enforcing numerous safety regulations, including on grade-crossings\u2019 warning systems; conducting focused inspections, audits, and accident providing technical assistance to railroads and other stakeholders. Specifically, FRA oversees rail safety through eight regional offices and through headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. Regional staff monitor railroads\u2019 compliance with federal safety regulations through inspections and provide technical assistance and guidance to states. In 2017, FRA created a new discipline for grade-crossing safety and is hiring new grade-crossing inspectors. These inspectors conduct field investigations, identify regulatory defects and violations, recommend civil penalty assessments when appropriate, and may participate in state- DOT-led teams that conduct on-site reviews of grade crossings to evaluate potential safety improvements. According to FRA documentation, FRA\u2019s new inspectors will also work with a variety of stakeholders to institute new types of training, explore new safety concepts and technologies, and assist in the development of new or modified highway-rail grade-crossing-safety regulations, initiatives, and programs. The inspectors will also work with FHWA and other DOT operating administrations in a cooperative effort to improve grade- crossing safety. FRA regional staff also investigates select railroad crashes, including those at grade crossings, to determine root causation and any contributing factors, so that railroads can implement corrective actions. FRA headquarters staff develops analytical tools for states to use to prioritize grade-crossing projects. In addition, headquarters staff manages research and development to support improved railroad safety, including at grade crossings. FRA\u2019s Office of Railroad Safety maintains the National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory database and the Railroad Accident/Incident Reporting System on grade-crossing crashes. Both states and railroads submit information to FRA\u2019s crossing inventory, which is designed to contain information on every grade crossing in the nation. Railroads submit information such as train speed and volume; states submit information such as highway speed limits and average annual daily traffic. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 added requirements for both railroads and states to periodically update the inventory; however, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) repealed a provision providing DOT authority to issue implementing regulations that would govern states\u2019 reporting to the inventory. According to FRA officials, while FRA\u2019s regulations do not require states to report the information, FRA encourages them to do so. FRA regulations require railroads to report and update their information in the inventory every 3 years or sooner in some instances, such as if new warning devices are installed or the grade crossing is closed. FRA\u2019s accident system contains details about each grade-crossing accident that has occurred. In addition to submitting immediate reports of fatal grade-crossing crashes, railroads are required to submit accident reports within 30 days after the end of the month in which the accident occurred and describe conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., visibility and weather); information on the grade crossing (e.g., type of warning device); and information on the driver (e.g., gender and age). In its role overseeing grade-crossing safety, FRA has sponsored a number of research efforts to better understand the causes of grade- crossing crashes and identify potential ways to improve engineering, education, and enforcement efforts. For example, FRA sponsored an in- depth data analysis of grade-crossing crashes to better identify which crossing characteristics increase the risk of an accident. The report, issued in 2017, found that the volumes of train and vehicle traffic at a crossing are the biggest predictors of grade-crossing crashes. Changes in vehicle and train traffic therefore affect the annual number of grade- crossing crashes. For example, as highway traffic decreased in 2008, possibly due to the economic recession and higher gas prices, so too did the number of grade-crossing crashes. As previously noted, FRA expects that the number of grade-crossing crashes will likely grow with anticipated increases in future train and highway traffic. As discussed below, vehicle and train volume are included in the U.S. DOT Accident Prediction Model, which some states use to select grade-crossing improvement projects. According to FRA officials, FRA is using the results of this recent in-depth data analysis to, in part, evaluate whether additional risk factors, such as the number of male drivers or trains carrying toxic materials, should be added to the model. FRA has targeted other research into understanding driver behavior at grade crossings, which is the leading cause of crashes. According to FRA\u2019s accident data, in 2017, 71 percent of fatal crashes at public grade crossings occurred at those with gates. In 2004, the DOT Inspector General (IG) reported that 94 percent of grade-crossing crashes from 1994 to 2003 could be attributed to risky driver behavior or poor judgement. State officials we spoke with explained that drivers may become impatient waiting at a grade crossing and decide to go around the gates. Drivers may also line up over the grade crossing in heavy vehicular traffic, and be unable to exit before the gates come down. See figure 3 for examples of risky driver behavior at grade crossings. To better understand driver behavior, FRA sponsored a John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) study that recorded and analyzed drivers\u2019 actions as they approached grade crossings. The researchers found that almost half of drivers were doing another task, such as eating, and over a third did not look in either direction while approaching passive grade crossings. We have previously reported, and many stakeholders we interviewed agreed, that in light of inappropriate driver behavior, technological solutions alone may not fully resolve safety issues at grade crossings. In addition, public-education and law-enforcement efforts can augment the effectiveness of technological solutions. According to FRA officials, they shared information on driver education with DOT\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as NHTSA works more closely with states on driver education manuals. According to DOT officials, NHTSA updates its driver education materials every 2\u20133 years and plans to consider including grade-crossing-safety materials in the next versions. FRA is also working with states and localities to research and develop new protective devices and other safety measures targeted at improving driver behavior at grade crossings. As most fatal crashes happen at grade crossings already equipped with gates, FRA and state and local agencies are exploring whether additional safety measures can improve safety at those locations. For example, in 2016 and 2017, FRA\u2019s Grade Crossing Task Force worked with the Volpe Center and the City of Orlando to test whether photo enforcement at grade crossings could reduce risky driver behavior. The City of Orlando installed automated photo-enforcement devices at a grade crossing, and instead of issuing fines to drivers who had violated its warning devices, sent drivers a warning notice and educational safety materials. Eight months after the photo-enforcement system was installed, grade crossing violations decreased by 15 percent. While FRA judged these enforcement efforts successful at changing driver behavior, a 2015 FRA whitepaper noted that photo enforcement equipment is costly\u2014on average costing over $300,000 per crossing to install and operate for 2 years\u2014and may not be cost-effective for most grade crossings. FRA found that due to costs and state laws prohibiting photo-enforcement, only two photo- enforcement cameras were currently in operation at grade crossings across the country. States, localities, and FHWA are also exploring whether new types of pavement markings at grade crossings can improve driver behavior. According to DOT officials, FHWA is working with two states to develop new cross-hatch pavement markings for grade crossings that would comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, similar to the \u201cdon\u2019t block the box\u201d type pavement markings used in intersections. FHWA also worked with a city to test the use of in-roadway lights to delineate the crossing. (See fig. 4). FRA and state DOTs are also trying to improve pedestrian safety at grade crossings by developing new safety measures. Grade-crossing accidents involving pedestrians are less frequent than those involving automobiles at grade crossings but have a higher fatality rate. While pedestrians were involved in only 9 percent of accidents at public crossings in 2017, almost 40 percent of fatal grade-crossing accidents involved pedestrians. To try to improve pedestrian safety, in 2012 the Volpe Center worked with New Jersey Transit to study whether adding additional pedestrian gate skirts\u2014 hanging gates that further block a crossing (see fig. 5)\u2014would prevent people from ducking under the gates. The Volpe Center reported that these new gates had mixed success. While incidents of people going under and around the gates decreased, more people chose to cross the tracks in the street rather than at the sidewalk. Finally, FRA is exploring new automated and connected vehicle technologies that could reduce risky driver behavior at grade crossings. FRA, FHWA, and officials from one state we interviewed said they anticipate that such technology will be critical to further improving safety. Specifically, FRA and FHWA are coordinating with DOT\u2019s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office to develop pilot technology that would enable crossing infrastructure or trains to communicate wirelessly with vehicles. Vehicles can use this information to warn the driver that a crash or violation is imminent, or integrate with onboard active safety systems. According to FRA officials, they completed a proof of concept in 2013 and completed and tested a prototype of the technology in 2017. DOT officials said that DOT does not have a time frame for when automakers might begin incorporating such connected vehicle technologies and noted that retrofitting older cars with new equipment will likely make this a long-term effort. FRA shares information on its research in various ways with state DOTs, because states are responsible for deciding which safety measures to install at grade crossings. Specifically, FRA and FHWA jointly hold quarterly webinars with stakeholders, including state DOT officials, and conduct presentations at highway-rail safety workshops. Information on safety measures such as grade-crossing devices, signs, and markings are also included in the Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook. According to DOT officials, the handbook was developed jointly by FHWA and FRA. The last version of the handbook was updated in 2007 and includes some out of date information. FRA and FHWA officials said they began working on an update in 2017, but missed the July 2018 target completion date. According to FHWA officials, updating the handbook is a complex undertaking that has taken more time than they anticipated due to the extensive collaboration required among stakeholders. FHWA officials said they anticipate completing the update during the spring of 2019. The risk of crashes at public grade crossings within a state factors into states\u2019 selection of over 1,000 new Section 130 Program projects nationally each fiscal year. FHWA requires states to develop a grade crossing program that considers relative risk. FHWA officials said they review the methods that states use to select projects to ensure that risk is considered. According to a 2016 academic study of 50 states, most states use mathematical formulas, or \u201caccident prediction models,\u201d to help assess risk and identify grade crossings for potential projects. More specifically, these accident prediction models use factors such as grade crossing characteristics and accident history to rank grade crossings by risk. DOT provides one such model\u2014the Accident Prediction Model\u2014and some states have developed their own models. The study reported that 19 states used DOT\u2019s model and 20 states used a different model. It also found that the DOT and commonly used state models include some similar grade-crossing characteristics to predict accident risk. For example, the selected models reviewed all considered vehicle- and train- traffic volume, which FRA has found to be the strongest predictors of grade-crossing crashes. FRA makes its Accident Prediction Model available to states online through its Web Accident Prediction System. This system is an online tool that uses FRA\u2019s crossing inventory, crossing collision history, and the DOT Accident Prediction Model to predict accident risk for grade crossings in each state. Only one of the eight states in our review used the system as its primary source for ranking grade-crossing risk. Most of the other states perform their own calculations to rank grade crossings. Officials from two states said that they believe their state-maintained data are more reliable than FRA\u2019s crossing inventory and explained that they go directly to their contacts at railroads to get updated information on factors such as train volume. Accident prediction models are only one source of information states use when selecting Section 130 Program projects. According to the state officials we spoke with, a variety of other considerations can also influence their decisions, including the following: Proximity of projects together along a railroad \u201ccorridor\u201d in order to gain efficiencies and reduce construction costs. Requests from local jurisdictions or railroads. These stakeholders may have information on upcoming changes at a grade crossing, such as higher train volume or new housing developments nearby, which would increase risk but would not be reflected yet in the accident prediction model. Availability of local funding to provide the required 10 percent match for Section 130 Program projects, while trying to spread the funds fairly across the state. States may also consider grade crossings that have had close calls in the past, such as where a car narrowly avoided being hit by a train. FRA does not require railroads to report on these close calls, or \u201cnear misses;\u201d however, according to state officials, railroads sometimes provide this information to states on an ad-hoc basis. State officials from four of the eight states we spoke with said they considered near misses when selecting Section 130 Program projects. A 2004 Volpe Center report noted that studying close calls was a proactive way to improve safety. According to the report, FRA sponsored a workshop to learn about the benefits of collecting and analyzing close calls. However, stakeholders we interviewed noted challenges formalizing near-miss reporting. For example, Volpe Center officials said these reports are subjective in nature\u2014what one engineer considers a close call, others may not. FRA developed another online tool\u2014GradeDec\u2014to allow states to compare the costs and benefits for various grade-crossing improvement projects. GradeDec uses models to analyze a project\u2019s risk and calculate cost-benefit ratios and net present value for potential projects. FRA provides state DOTs with on-site GradeDec workshops upon request. While FRA officials noted that many state and local governments have registered to use the program, none of the state officials we spoke with identified GradeDec as a tool that they use to conduct cost-benefit analysis. Officials from two state DOTs we spoke with said that cost- benefit analyses could help them better identify and select the most cost- effective crossing safety projects in the future. According to the academic study of 50 states noted above, because of limited funding for grade-crossing improvements, states should consider the life-cycle costs of the projects as well as net present value to help select projects. As discussed later in this report, the small number of crashes at grade crossings can make it challenging to distinguish between different projects in terms of their effectiveness in reducing accidents. Finally, after they have considered risk factors and created a list of potential grade crossings for improvement, state officials, along with relevant stakeholders from railroads and local governments, conduct field reviews of the potential projects. According to state officials, these reviews help identify grade-crossing characteristics that may not be included in the accident prediction models, such as vegetation that would obstruct drivers\u2019 views. In 2008, legislation was enacted mandating reporting by states and railroads to the National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory. However, the fact that reporting to the inventory remained voluntary until 2015 has had lingering effects on the completeness of the data in the inventory. In 2015, as mandated by statute, FRA issued regulations requiring railroads to update certain data elements for all grade crossings every 3 years. However, our analysis of FRA\u2019s crossing inventory found that 4 percent of grade crossings were last updated in 2009 or earlier. In addition, because MAP-21 repealed DOT\u2019s authority to issue regulations that would govern state reporting to the inventory, state reporting of grade-crossing data remains voluntary, according to FRA officials, and all state-reported information is not complete. Our analysis of state-reported data in FRA\u2019s crossing inventory found varying levels of completeness. For example, while some state-reported data fields were almost entirely complete, 33 percent of public grade crossings were missing data on posted highway speed. We also found that of the crossings for which states reported the year when the highway-traffic count was conducted, 64 percent of the highway-traffic counts for public grade crossings, another important risk factor, had not been updated since 2009, or earlier. According to the 2015 final rule, FRA will continue to evaluate whether additional regulations to address state reporting are needed to maintain the crossing inventory\u2019s accuracy. FRA officials told us that improving inventory data will help them better deploy their limited resources, particularly their grade-crossing inspectors, and said that they have taken steps to help improve the data. In 2017, FRA regional officials conducted field reviews to verify the latitude and longitude data for grade crossings in the inventory, data that states are responsible for updating. In addition, FRA expects its grade-crossing inspectors as part of their inspections to review and identify issues with the railroad- and state-reported inventory data. According to FRA officials, FRA has begun to both transition its 19 grade-crossing managers into grade-crossing inspectors and also hire new inspectors, for an eventual total of 24 inspectors and eight regional specialists to supervise their activities. To help ensure railroads\u2019 compliance with crossing inventory regulations, officials said that the inspectors will use spot checks to validate the inventory data by comparing grade-crossing characteristics in the field with the information railroads submitted to the inventory. In addition, FRA has incorporated information on inventory-reporting requirements into the grade-crossing inspectors\u2019 training. Finally, FRA is currently developing guidelines for the grade-crossing inspections similar to those for other FRA safety disciplines. FRA headquarters officials acknowledged that they are still clarifying the details for the inspections that will be included in the compliance manuals that inspectors will use. Specifically, they said they are still determining appropriate inspector workloads and drafting specific guidelines that will need to be integrated into FRA\u2019s regional inspection plans. FRA officials said they are working to develop and make available inventory inspection guidance to the grade-crossing managers and inspectors by December 31, 2018. In the meantime, FRA held training that included information on inventory-reporting requirements. In August 2018, FRA developed guidance for grade-crossing inspections specific to quiet zones in response to a recommendation we made in 2017. It is important that FRA meets its goal to issue similar guidance specific to reviewing the accuracy of the inventory data, as FRA cannot have reasonable assurance that inspections that are already under way are being conducted in such a manner that would allow them to consistently identify data reliability issues at each crossing. About 75 percent of all Section 130 Program projects states implemented in fiscal year 2016 involved installing or updating active grade-crossing equipment, including warning lights and protective gates (see fig. 6). The prevalence of this type of project is in part due to the Section 130 Program requirement that states spend at least 50 percent of funds on protective devices. Other than eliminating a grade crossing, adding protective devices has long been considered the most effective way of reducing the risk of a crash. Officials from six of eight state DOTs we interviewed told us that the numbers and types of grade-crossing projects they implement are dependent on the amount of Section 130 Program funding they receive and the cost of the projects. As previously described, funds are set aside from the Highway Safety Improvement Program and distributed to states by a statutory formula that includes factors such as the number of grade crossings in each state. Officials from six of the eight state DOTs we spoke to agreed that the set-aside nature of the program was crucial in allowing them to implement projects, many of which they said would not have been possible without Section 130 Program funds. For example, many said the formula funding ensures that grade-crossing projects are completed along with highway safety projects, particularly given the fact that fatalities resulting from grade-crossing crashes account for so few when compared to highway deaths. Overall, fatalities resulting from grade-crossing crashes account for less than 1 percent of all highway- related fatalities. In fiscal year 2018, the funds distributed ranged from a low of approximately $1.2 million for eight states and Washington, D.C., to over $16 million for California and over $19 million for Texas. The number of grade crossings in the eight states and Washington, D.C. ranged from 5 to 380, while California had almost 6,000 and Texas had over 9,000. Project implementation costs varied by project type and ranged widely depending on project scope. Based on 2016 DOT data, some typical project costs ranged as follows: adding signs to passive grade crossings\u2014$500 to $1,500; adding flashing lights and two gates to passive grade crossings\u2014 $150,000 to $300,000; adding four gates to grade crossings with flashing lights\u2014$250,000 - closing a grade crossing\u2014$25,000 to $100,000; and separating a grade crossing from traffic (Grade Separation)\u2014$5 million to $40 million. State officials we spoke with cited several challenges in pursuing certain types of controversial, innovative, and expensive projects that could help them address the evolving nature of risk at grade crossings and difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of their projects. First, most state DOT officials said that the cost of grade-separation projects and, at times, the controversy of eliminating grade crossings through closure reduces the number of these projects, while acknowledging that they are the most effective ways to improve safety. These types of projects made up only 3 percent of Section 130 Program projects in fiscal year 2016 (see fig. 6). Grade-separation projects are often more expensive than the annual Section 130 Program funding available to states. In 2018, only eight states received annual Section 130 Program funding sufficient to fund a $7-million grade-separation project. As discussed previously, to fund relatively expensive projects, states may choose to combine funds from multiple years. Also, states and railroads may make incentive payments to localities for the permanent closure of a grade crossing. In addition to the cost, most state DOT officials reported challenges obtaining local support for closing grade crossings. They said closures may inconvenience residents who use the road and force emergency responders to take longer routes, potentially slowing response times. Grade-separation projects address these safety concerns and may be more agreeable to residents, but they are substantially more expensive. While up to $7,500 in Section 130 Program funding can be used to help incentivize communities to close grade crossings, officials from some of our selected state DOTs said this amount is generally not enough to persuade local officials to support the closing. Second, officials from many state DOTs we interviewed also reported that the requirements of the Section 130 Program create challenges for them in implementing what they considered to be innovative projects. For example, the program requirement that 50 percent of funds be used on protective devices, combined with what one researcher described to us as the tendency by states to implement \u201cknown\u201d projects\u2014i.e., protective devices\u2014may impede states\u2019 selection of new, more innovative safety projects. Officials we interviewed from many state DOTs described challenges related to the program\u2019s requirements. They noted that they are prevented from using Section 130 Program funds for new types of safety technologies not yet incorporated into FHWA\u2019s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. As noted previously in this report, outside the Section 130 Program FHWA is working with states and localities to explore whether new types of pavement markings at grade crossings, not in the manual, can improve driver behavior. One state DOT official we interviewed suggested changes to allow states to fund one grade- crossing pilot project per year or to use a set percentage of program funds to finance a pilot project that could help them explore promising but as yet unproven technologies. Third, state DOT officials from four of the eight selected states also said it can be difficult to find funding for the required 10 percent state match. As previously mentioned, while certain rail-safety projects are eligible for up to 100 percent federal funding, Section 130 Program projects are funded at a 90 percent federal share. According to DOT documentation we reviewed, only some states have a dedicated source for such a match, and state DOT officials from one of our selected states said their state cannot use state funds for the 10 percent match. Some state DOT officials said this situation can drive project selection. For example, they sometimes chose projects based on which localities or railroads were willing to provide matching funds or offer cost savings. Finally, many state officials cited challenges in measuring the effectiveness of grade crossing projects in reducing crashes or the risk of crashes. In particular, state officials we spoke to said it can be difficult to use before-and-after crash statistics as a measure of effectiveness because of the low number and random nature of crashes. Also, as FRA research has shown and as FHWA and FRA have noted, reporting on before-and-after grade-crossing accident statistics can be misleading, given the infrequency of crashes and crashes that are not the result of grade crossing conditions. States\u2019 required Section 130 Program annual progress reports to the Secretary of DOT call for states to report on the effectiveness of the improvements they made. FHWA reporting guidance suggests they define effectiveness as the reduction in the number of fatalities and serious injuries after grade-crossing projects were implemented, consistent with statutory requirements. In addition, FHWA guidance states that consideration should be given to quantifying effectiveness in the context of fatalities and serious injuries. However, states often report no differences in crashes after specific projects were implemented, and there have been instances where states reported a slight increase in crashes. Such an increase does not necessarily mean that the project was not effective in reducing the overall risk of a crash. Also, not all projects are implemented at grade crossings where there has been a crash. Among other information, states also typically report information on funding and data on the numbers and types of projects implemented. In addition, the extent to which states report projects\u2019 effectiveness varies greatly. Given states\u2019 responsibility for implementing the Section 130 Program and the differences in the amounts of funding they receive, FHWA officials said states should determine and report on the appropriate effectiveness metrics for their programs. According to FHWA officials, during the 2017 reporting year, a few states requested examples of what to include when reporting effectiveness, and FHWA responded with examples of various methods they could use, such as a benefit-cost ratio or the percentage decrease in fatalities, serious injuries, and crashes. Regardless of the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of specific projects, most state DOT officials we interviewed stressed the importance of the Section 130 Program in funding grade-crossing projects. FHWA\u2019s biennial report to Congress is intended to provide information to Congress on the progress being made by the states in implementing projects to improve safety and, in addition, make recommendations for future implementation of the program. FHWA reviews states\u2019 annual Section 130 Program reports and uses them to formulate the report to Congress every 2 years. FHWA\u2019s 2018 report highlights that the Section 130 Program has seen great success since 1975, with a decrease of approximately 74 percent in fatalities at the same time that there was an increase in vehicle and train traffic. The report described the latest available 10-year trend, from 2007 to 2016, as showing a 31 percent decrease in fatalities. Fatalities have also decreased when adjusted for train traffic. However, FHWA officials acknowledged in interviews with us that crashes and fatalities have remained constant since about 2009, with more recent data showing a slight increase in fatalities over the last 2 to 3 years, data that are consistent with the increases in overall roadway fatalities. The officials said increased train- and vehicle-traffic volumes could be contributing to that increase, in addition to other factors, such as more bicycle riders and pedestrians using grade crossings. As described earlier, states have generally already used Section 130 Program funding to address safety at the riskiest grade crossings by adding protective measures, typically lights and gates. Yet crashes continue to occur at these improved grade crossings. Given these trends and the challenges discussed earlier related to the requirements of the Section 130 Program, it is not clear whether the program remains effective in continuing to reduce the risk of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings. As required, FHWA\u2019s biennial report includes a section on \u201crecommendations for future implementation\u201d of the Section 130 Program. As part of this, FHWA reports on challenges and actions being taken to address them. FHWA\u2019s 2018 report identified one of the same challenges we heard about from state DOT officials related to the inability or unwillingness of local agencies to provide matching funds and the relatively low amount of funding designed to incentivize localities to close crossings. FHWA reported on its efforts to address these challenges, including by providing guidance, resources, and supportive training to states and local agencies and serving as a clearinghouse for innovative methods of supporting projects. However, with the exception of the funding challenge, FHWA\u2019s most recent report does not include the other challenges state officials identified to us related to the requirements of the Section 130 Program discussed above. These include program funding requirements that may impede innovative approaches and the difficulties of using before-and-after crash statistics to measure effectiveness. Many state DOT officials we spoke with said there may be an opportunity to more broadly assess the Section 130 Program at the national level. It could be more informative to comprehensively assess more detailed crash trends, such as those that look forward over multiple years across the more than 1,700 crashes nationwide, rather than on the approximately 35 that occur on average within a state, and identify strategies to address those trends. Doing so could help FHWA learn more about why crashes are continuing and what types of projects may be effective. There could be ways to evaluate the program in a more comprehensive way; many state DOT officials we interviewed told us such a comprehensive evaluation could help improve program effectiveness in a number of ways, including by enabling the program to better keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and re- examining eligibility requirements that limit the flexibility of states to consider other types of projects beyond engineering. Also, most state DOT officials we interviewed agreed that education and enforcement efforts are crucial to further improving safety, as did 8 out of 10 other stakeholders we spoke to, as well as officials from Volpe Center and NTSB. However, according to FHWA officials, those project types are not allowed under the Section 130 Program\u2019s requirements. The officials said FHWA has partnered with FRA and NHTSA on research efforts, such as driver-behavior studies, to inform grade-crossing safety issues. However, the officials said that FHWA has not conducted a program evaluation of the Section 130 Program to consider whether the program\u2019s funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues such as driver behavior. FHWA officials said that there is no federal requirement for them to conduct such a program evaluation. We have previously reported that an important component of effective program management is through program performance assessment, which helps establish a program\u2019s effectiveness\u2014the extent to which a program is operating as it was intended and the extent to which a program achieves what the agency proposes to accomplish. This type of evaluative information helps the executive branch and congressional committees make decisions about the programs they oversee. Assessing program performance includes conducting program evaluations, which are individual systematic studies that answer specific questions about how well a program is meeting its objectives. In addition, federal internal-control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to significant changes in a program\u2019s environment that could pose new risks. FHWA officials said the fact that crashes and fatalities have held steady while the volume of train and vehicle traffic has increased is an indication that grade-crossing safety has continued to improve. However, specific to fatalities per million train-miles, FHWA\u2019s 2018 biennial report shows this rate to be fairly constant since 2009. As noted previously, FRA expects train and traffic volumes to continue to increase and has expressed concern that grade-crossing crashes and fatalities may also increase. Without conducting a program evaluation, FHWA cannot ensure that the Section 130 Program is achieving one of the national goals of the federal- aid highway program, to reduce fatalities and injuries. In addition, It is difficult to see how FHWA, in its biennial reports to Congress, could make informed recommendations for future program implementation without conducting a program evaluation to assess, among other things, whether program requirements first established some four decades ago continue to reduce fatalities and injuries. We note that as part of a program evaluation, some changes that FHWA, working with FRA, identifies as potentially having merit to improve the program\u2019s effectiveness could require a statutory change. The continued number of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings with devices intended to warn of a train\u2019s presence calls into question whether the Section 130 Program is structured to help states continue making progress toward the national goal to reduce fatalities and injuries. An evaluation of the program\u2019s requirements could help determine whether Congress should consider better ways to focus federal funds to address the key factor in crashes\u2014risky driver behavior. An FHWA program evaluation could also help determine whether, for example, states could more strategically target emerging safety problems if changes were made to the types of projects eligible for funding under the Section 130 Program. FRA\u2019s new grade-crossing inspectors are meant to increase the effectiveness of FRA\u2019s rail-safety oversight activities, and accordingly, these FRA inspectors, along with FRA researchers, may be well positioned to help FHWA evaluate potential changes to improve the effectiveness of the Section 130 Program. The Administrator of FHWA, working with FRA, should evaluate the Section 130 Program\u2019s requirements to determine whether they allow states sufficient flexibility to adequately address current and emerging grade-crossing safety issues. As part of this evaluation, FHWA should determine whether statutory changes to the program are necessary to improve its effectiveness. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment. In written comments, reproduced in appendix II, DOT concurred with our recommendation. DOT also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, and the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-2834 or flemings@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This report examines (1) what has been the focus of Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s (FRA) grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what railroad- and state-reported data are available from FRA to inform states\u2019 decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) assesses the program\u2019s effectiveness. The scope of this work focused on the nation\u2019s more than 128,000 public grade crossings. We did not include private grade crossings, as states can only use Railway- Highway Crossings Program (commonly referred to as the Section 130 Program) funds to improve safety at public grade crossings. While FRA provides safety grants to address rail issues, including for grade-crossing projects, we focused our work on the Section 130 Program because it is the primary source of federal funding directed at grade-crossing-safety improvement. For each objective we reviewed: pertinent statutes and FHWA and FRA regulations and documents; interviewed FHWA and FRA program officials in headquarters; and conducted in-depth interviews with a non- generalizable sample of organizations that included officials from 4 freight and passenger railroads, 12 state agencies from 8 states, 6 FRA regional offices, and 8 FHWA state division offices. We also spoke with representatives from relevant associations and officials from NTSB and Volpe Center. We selected these organizations based on our initial background research, prior work, and input from other stakeholders, among other things. See the paragraph below for additional selection details and table 5 for a complete list of organizations we spoke with. We selected eight states as part of our non-generalizable sample for interviews. These states included Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The states were selected to include a mix of state experiences based on a variety of factors, including the number of grade crossings and crashes at those crossings, and the amount of Section 130 Program funding they received. Specifically, we selected four states from those in the top 25 percent of all states in terms of their number of grade crossings and the amount of Section 130 Program funds they received. We selected the other four states to include a mix of these factors. We also considered geographical diversity and recommendations from FRA and FHWA officials. Within these eight states, we conducted in-depth interviews with FHWA division staff, FRA regional staff, and state officials. A variety of state agencies administer the Section 130 Program within their state; the state officials we spoke with from our eight selected states worked for agencies such as state departments of transportation, corporation commissions, and public utility commissions. We also spoke with a non-generalizable sample of four railroads: Amtrak, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Sierra Northern. We selected railroads based on a variety of factors including geographic location and stakeholder recommendations. We also conducted additional work related to each of the objectives. To describe the focus of FRA\u2019s grade-crossing-safety research, we examined FRA research aimed at understanding the causes of grade- crossing crashes and identifying potential improvements and described FRA efforts to test new approaches that could improve safety. We did not assess the quality of FRA\u2019s research, as that was beyond the scope of this engagement. Instead, we described the nature of the research. We also spoke with FRA research and development staff, Volpe researchers, and state partners about this work. To describe how states select and implement grade-crossing projects, and what FRA data are available to inform their decisions, we reviewed an academic study that included a literature review and interviews with state officials to describe how states select Section 130 Program projects. We spoke with the researcher and determined the study to be reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We also spoke with officials from our eight selected states, FHWA division staff, and FRA regional staff, and reviewed the states\u2019 2017 Section 130 Program reports. As part of this objective, we also assessed the reliability of data reported for all railroads in FRA\u2019s National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory data as of August 31, 2018. For public grade crossings that were not closed, we examined a selection of fields within the database to identify the frequency of missing data (see table 1), data anomalies (see table 2), relational errors, where two related data fields had values that were incompatible (see table 3), and when the data was last updated (see table 4). Specifically, we conducted the following electronic tests on the crossing inventory data to determine if they were within reasonable ranges, were internally consistent, and appeared complete: Before conducting our analysis, we filtered the inventory data to only include open, public, at-grade crossings. To understand FRA\u2019s efforts to improve its crossing inventory data, we interviewed FRA regional and headquarters staff and reviewed job descriptions for FRA\u2019s new grade- crossing inspectors. Finally, to determine the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing grade-crossing safety projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program\u2019s effectiveness, we reviewed program requirements and state project data and other components from FHWA\u2019s 2016 and 2018 Section 130 Program biennial reports to Congress. We also reviewed FHWA\u2019s summary of fiscal year 2018 program funds provided to states and federal laws and guidance related to implementing projects and measuring performance. We interviewed state DOT officials from the eight selected states and other stakeholders on the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects, and FHWA and FRA officials for their perspectives on managing the program, including how FHWA measures performance and assesses program effectiveness. We compared information collected from FHWA and FRA to federal internal-control standards and criteria on program evaluation identified in our previous work. In addition, we reviewed FHWA and FRA documents designed to guide states, such as the Grade Crossing Handbook, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, the Action Plan and Project Prioritization Noteworthy Practices Guide, and other related documents. We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to November 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Susan A. Fleming, (202) 512-2834, Flemings@gao.gov.

                "Crashes at highway-rail grade crossings are one of the leading causes of railroad-related deaths. According to FRA data, in 2017, there were more than 2,100 crashes resulting in 273 fatalities. Since 2009 crashes have occurred at a fairly constant rate. The federal government provides states funding to improve grade-crossing safety through FHWA's Section 130 Program. The persistence of crashes and deaths raises questions about the effectiveness of the federal grade-crossing-safety program. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to improve grade-crossing safety. This report examines: (1) the focus of FRA's grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what data are available from FRA to inform their decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO analyzed FRA data; reviewed FRA's, FHWA's, and states' documents; reviewed a study of states' selection of projects; and interviewed FRA and FHWA headquarters and field staff, and officials from a non-generalizable sample of eight states, selected to include a mix in the number of grade crossings and crashes, and geographic diversity. Research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has identified driver behavior as the main cause of highway-rail grade crossing crashes and that factors such as train and traffic volume can contribute to the risk of a crash. (See figure.) Over 70 percent of fatal crashes in 2017 occurred at grade crossings with gates. To meet the requirements of the federal grade-crossing program, states are responsible for selecting and ensuring the implementation of grade-crossing improvement projects. Most state DOT officials and other relevant transportation officials use local knowledge of grade crossings to supplement the results of models that rank grade crossings based on the risk of an accident. These states generally consider the same primary risk factors, such as vehicle and train traffic. FRA is taking steps to improve the data used in its model to help states assess risk factors at grade crossings. For example, FRA's grade-crossing inspectors will review and identify issues with railroad- and state-reported inventory data. FRA is currently developing guidelines, which it plans to finalize by the end of 2018, to implement these inspections as it has for other types of FRA inspections. Officials we spoke with in eight states reported challenges in pursuing certain types of projects that could further enhance safety, in part because of federal requirements. While safety has improved, many crashes occur at grade crossings with gates, and officials said there could be additional ways to focus program requirements to continue improving safety. States' and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) reporting focuses on the program's funding and activity, such as the number and types of projects, yet the low number of crashes makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of projects in reducing crashes and fatalities. FHWA reports the program has been effective in reducing fatalities by about 74 percent since 1975. However, since 2009, annually there have been about 250 fatalities\u2014almost one percent of total highway fatalities. FRA expects future crashes to grow, in part, due to the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic. An evaluation of the program should consider whether its funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues. FHWA officials said they are not required to perform such evaluations. GAO has previously reported on the importance of program evaluations to determine the extent to which a program is meeting its objectives. An evaluation of the program could lead FHWA to identify changes that could allow states to more strategically address problem areas. GAO recommends that FHWA evaluate the program's requirements to determine if they allow states the flexibility to address ongoing safety issues. The Department of Transportation concurred with GAO's recommendation."

            "context": "Passage 1:\nCigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but thanks to recent research we now know it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers\u2019 discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA\u2019s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.

Infection and Immunity. 2015.\nPassage 2:\nCigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses, according to a new study led by UC San Diego scientists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill, said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crotty Alexander is senior author of the paper, published Monday in the journal Infection and Immunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is similar to one published last May, in which the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance was examined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. \u2014 Hayne Palmour IV Share Photo \uf610 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \uf611 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2709 Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. \u2014 Hayne Palmour IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, Crotty Alexander said. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Crotty's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worse, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions. At that rate, a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we put these cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality,\" compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed, Crotty Alexander said in a phone interview Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cigarette smoke helped the bacteria kill more mice, whereas the e-cigarette vapor was just on the borderline,\" Crotty Alexander said. \"It did make it a little more aggressive, but not as much as the cigarette smoke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. \u2014 NIAID Share Photo \uf610 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \uf611 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2709 Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. / NIAID NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study stated it was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because MRSA causes severe pneumonia more often than MSSA, and because MRSA commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and airways and thus is exposed to inhaled substances, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke on MRSA resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice,\" the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests on human cells found the same result, Crotty Alexander said. Previous research has shown that cigarette smoke harms human respiratory and immune cells, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the picture now is that cigarette smoke both harms smokers and assists pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Study co-authors include Elisa K. McEachern, John H.

                "Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)"

But Arnold Schwarzenegger's hosting debut wasn't enough to give the network a ratings win for the show's premiere.

With Schwarzenegger now in the hosting chair, The New Celebrity Apprentice averaged roughly 4.9 million total viewers across its two-hour premiere, according to Nielsen's tracking numbers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ABC's two-hour The Bachelor premiere pulled in nearly 6.6 million viewers by comparison, while CBS averaged more than 6 million viewers between four half-hour sitcoms that aired between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While NBC heavily promoted Schwarzenegger's Apprentice takeover ahead of the show's January debut, the movie star and former California governor's reality TV turn got off to a mediocre start, especially when compared with the ratings of his predecessor. The ratings for last night's Celebrity Apprentice premiere were down more than 22% from the debut episode of Trump's most recent season hosting (2014-2015). The show averaged 7.6 million nightly viewers in that season, and the ratings for the key demographic (viewers aged 18 to 49) across that season was roughly 46% higher than what Schwarzenegger's debut scored on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The network has been pushing the show's new host and new season for months, including weathering last month's controversy over the fact that president-elect Trump will continue receiving an executive producer credit on the show going forward.

Still, NBC ( cmcsa ) was likely hoping for a more impressive start to the post-Trump era of its Apprentice franchise, even though some early reviews for the Schwarzenegger-led show were not particularly kind .

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Central California woman claims she was fired after uninstalling an app that her employer required her to run constantly on her company issued iPhone\u2014an app that tracked her every move 24 hours a day, seven days a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaintiff Myrna Arias, a former Bakersfield sales executive for money transfer service Intermex, claims in a state court lawsuit that her boss, John Stubits, fired her shortly after she uninstalled the job-management Xora app that she and her colleagues were required to use. According to her suit (PDF) in Kern County Superior Court: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After researching the app and speaking with a trainer from Xora, Plaintiff and her co-workers asked whether Intermex would be monitoring their movements while off duty. Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she installed the app on her phone. Plaintiff expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion\u2026.. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Intermex did not immediately respond for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit, which claims invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and other allegations, seeks damages in excess of $500,000 and asserts she was monitored on the weekends when she was not working. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias' boss \"scolded\" her for uninstalling the app shortly after being required to use it, according to the suit. Her attorneys said the woman made $7,250 per month and that she \"met all quotas\" during a brief stint with Intermex last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person,\" the filing said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, said in a Monday e-mail to Ars that the app allowed her client's \"bosses to see every move the employees made throughout the day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The app had a \"clock in/out\" feature which did not stop GPS monitoring, that function remained on. This is the problem about which Ms. Arias complained. Management never made mention of mileage.

(CN) - A money-transfer company fired an employee for refusing to install an app that would track her location even when she was off the clock, the woman claims in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Myrna Arias sued Intermex Wire Transfer LLC in Kern County Superior Court on May 5. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Intermex describes itself on its website as \" a leading processor of money-transfer services in the U.S. to Latin America corridor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has 30,000 locations worldwide and offers services in 45 states and 16 Latin American countries, the website adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says she worked for Intermex as a sales executive and account manager from February 2014 to May 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was still working for rival NetSpend Corporation when she was hired. Her boss, Intermex's regional vice president of sales John Stubits, agreed to let her work for both NetSpend and Intermex for three months until she qualified for Intermex's medical insurance because she was suffering from a severe vitamin B-12 deficiency and did not want to lose her treatment, according to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says she did well at her job, meeting all her quotas and earning around $7,250 a month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But everything changed in April 2014, when she claims Stubits told her and several other employees to download an app from Xora onto their smartphones that \"contained a global positioning system function which tracked the exact location of the person possessing the smartphones on which it was installed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Xora Inc., now ClickSoftware Solution, is not a party to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a September 2011 press release, the app enables employees to create electronic timecards on their phones to track when their shifts start, when they take breaks, and when a shift ends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaintiff attorney Gail Glick told Courthouse News that Arias was one of the first employees asked to put the app on her phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They were guinea pigs,\" Glick said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says in her complaint that she researched the app and asked Stubits if Intermex would be tracking her whereabouts when she was off the clock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she had installed the app on her phone,\" Arias says in her complaint. \"Plaintiff expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying plaintiff more than NetSpend.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stubits also told Arias she had to keep her phone on \"24/7\" to assist clients, and \"scolded\" her when she uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, the complaint adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says Intermex fired her a few weeks later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glick said that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a \"legitimate business interest\" to do so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But if an employee can't stop it, then that is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias objected to the app because there was no way to turn it off when she was at home. Even if she shut down the app on her phone, it would still be running in the background, Glick said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" she added. \"She was not underperforming, so there was no reason to monitor her.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To make matters worse, Glick said, Intermex was so angry at her objection to the app that it went \"above and beyond a normal wrongful termination and interfered with her ability to earn a livelihood.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says in her complaint that Robert Lisy, Intermex's president and CEO, \"telephoned John Nelson, vice president of NetSpend, and informed Nelson that plaintiff had been disloyal to NetSpend and was employed by Intermex. As a result of Lisy's intentional and malicious interference with plaintiff's contract with NetSpend, NetSpend fired plaintiff promptly. NetSpend specifically cited Lisy's phone call as the reason for the decision to terminate plaintiff,\" the complaint states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lisy, Nelson and NetSpend are not parties to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With two black marks against her and a gap in her employment record, Arias has had a hard time finding a new job, Glick said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives for Intermex did not respond to comment requests by press time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias seeks an injunction and general, special and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination and unfair business practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her attorney Gail A. Glick is with Alexander, Krakow & Glick of Santa Monica. \"We intend to pursue this aggressively and get her the justice she deserves,\" Glick said. \"What we have here is a really egregious situation, and we are hoping to right that wrong.\"\n",

            "context": "Passage 1:\nThe \u201csafest\u201d drug for relieving aches and pains, lowering fever and treating headaches in pregnancy may not be so safe after all, according to a new report \u2014 it may raise the risk of ADHD and similar disorders in their children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They say it doesn\u2019t mean that pregnant women must never, ever take the drug, but they said women may want to avoid using it frequently until more studies have been done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity,\u201d said Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist at the University of California Los Angeles who worked on the study. \"You should just avoid chronic or long-term use.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Infections such as influenza in pregnancy are known to affect the brain development of babies \u2014 they\u2019re linked to autism, for instance. It\u2019s one of the many reasons pregnant women are urged to get flu shots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the researchers in this study were careful to ask women if they were taking the acetaminophen pills to reduce a fever to treat flu symptoms. Even when taking this into account, women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team used an ongoing Danish study of 64,000 children and their mothers, who were called up regularly during pregnancy and asked whether they had taken any painkillers at all. \u201cAll these women were asked had they taken any pain medications and fever medications, any medications,\u201d Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity. \u2026 You should just avoid chronic or long-term use.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About half had taken acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, Ritz\u2019s team reports Monday in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey also reported what kind of disorders they had. But there are viral infections that the woman doesn\u2019t even recognize. She just feels a little malaise.\u201d That is why it is possible that it may not be the drug itself to blame, but some infection the women had, Ritz and other experts point out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s also possible that women who feel pain more acutely, and take painkillers more often, may also have some sort of genetic predisposition that raises the risk of ADHD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers were not able to make a clear estimate of risk based on dose. But women who reported ever taking the drug had a 29 percent higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD, and a 37 percent higher risk of a rarer diagnosis called hyperkinetic syndrome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the findings don't show a clear cause-and-effect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t think one study alone is enough to say nobody should use acetaminophen in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Chapa of Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital, who was not involved in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, there are suspicions about acetaminophen. UCLA\u2019s Dr. Jorn Olsen, who designed and led the study, had set it up because of lab studies suggesting that acetaminophen might have a hormone-like effect on the developing fetus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And it\u2019s not the first study to show something may happen in people, too. A study late last year showed that women who took acetaminophen frequently during pregnancy raised the risk of behavior problems in their children by 70 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPregnancy is just a very sensitive period of time where the hormones are very important to development,\u201d Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And although acetaminophen is considered a very gentle drug, it is not harmless. Large doses can damage the liver and even kill. The Food and Drug Administration has asked drug companies to limit how much they put into products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn\u2019t possible to compare acetaminophen to other painkillers and fever reducers, such as ibuprofen, because pregnant women so rarely took them, Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chapa raises another possibility. Maybe moms who favor acetaminophen for themselves also gave it to their children when they were very young and their brains were still developing. \u201cAre those moms also more likely to give acetaminophen to their children after birth?\u201d he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe immediate take-home message is that if you are taking a lot, maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kate Langley, a neuroscientist at Britain\u2019s Cardiff University, notes that it\u2019s likely that more than one thing is going on with kids who develop ADHD. \u201cADHD is a complex disorder so it means that there are lots of different risk factors and we know a bit about some of them but we don\u2019t know a great deal,\u201d said Langley, who helped write a commentary on the findings. \u201cWe know that there are genetic and environmental and possibly prenatal (factors) but we know that none of them on their own cause ADHD.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ADHD diagnoses are on the rise. More than 1 in 10 children has been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although much of this is due to awareness and not a real increase in incidence, experts say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, pregnant women need to weigh the risks, Ritz says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe make these tradeoffs all the time. We would not take a woman off antibiotics when she has a severe infection during pregnancy,\u201d Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s the risk-benefit ratio. As much as we want to avoid every type of risk, it is not possible.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this case, she advised, it might be worth toughing out a headache. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe immediate take-home message is that if you are taking a lot, maybe you shouldn\u2019t, and really question whether you need to take it,\u201d Chapa added. \u201cAnd if you do that\u2019s fine, but take a small quantity for a small duration. If you have chronic pain, maybe don\u2019t take acetaminophen for it.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McNeil Consumer Healthcare, which makes Tylenol, said pregnant and breastfeeding women whould consult their doctors before taking any medication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are aware of the recent JAMA Pediatrics study; however, there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development,\" the company said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NBC News intern Nikita Japra and Medical Fellow Hayley Goldbach contributed to this story.\nPassage 2:\nDoctors frequently recommend acetaminophen, commonly found in over-the-counter pain relievers including Tylenol, to pregnant women for treating mild pain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a new study out of Denmark suggests the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy could be associated with ADHD-like behavioral problems in children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201c(Pregnant women) shouldn\u2019t worry at this point,\u201d says study author Dr. Beate Ritz, professor and chair of the epidemiology department at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. \u201cBut if I were a woman who was pregnant ... I would try to avoid taking painkillers as much as I can until we know more about this.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from more than 64,000 children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002. Mothers in the cohort study reported on their children\u2019s behavior, and the researchers looked at databases to determine how many prescriptions for ADHD drugs were written and how many children received a diagnosis of a severe form of ADHD called hyperkinetic disorder, or HKD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study authors concluded that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with HKD or being prescribed ADHD medications and \u201cexhibiting ADHD-like behaviors.\" It's important to note that ADHD-like behaviors are not the same as having ADHD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An accompanying editorial published in JAMA Pediatrics emphasizes that the study has found \u201can interesting observed association,\u201d but that the researchers did not find that acetaminophen causes ADHD. The study authors agree that their results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks, Ritz says. When women reported use for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication, according to the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ritz says more than half of all mothers in the study reported some acetaminophen use while pregnant. The study measured how many weeks the mother reported taking any amount of acetaminophen but did not take the dosage into account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhen used as directed, Tylenol has one of the most favorable safety profiles among over-the-counter pain relievers,\u201d said McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol. \u201cWe are aware of the recent JAMA Pediatrics study; however, there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study\u2019s authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe cited literature is not relevant to the human condition,\u201d says Dr. Max Wiznitzer, pediatric neurologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that (women) will think, somehow, that they caused their child\u2019s problem when the study does not tell us that. It tells us that they are linked but does not tell us how.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere are a lot of variables that still need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families,\u201d Wiznitzer says. Seventy to 80% of ADHD cases are hereditary, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study highlights the importance of not taking a drug\u2019s safety during pregnancy for granted, the accompanying editorial points out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere are nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain,\u201d says Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital. Massages, baths and acupuncture are some alternatives he suggests to help relieve pain. \u201cI think we have to focus a little bit more on that as opposed to just medications.\u201d\n",

O\u2019Neill also ruled that Mr. Cosby qualified as a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d under state law.\nPassage 2:\nShortly after Bill Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison for sexual assault and taken away in handcuffs, his spokesperson Andrew Wyatt told reporters that Cosby \u2014 along with embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 was the victim of a \u201csex war.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhat is going on in Washington today with Judge Kavanaugh is part of that sex war that Judge [Steven] O\u2019Neill and his wife are a part of,\u201d Wyatt said, referring to the judge who oversaw Cosby\u2019s trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wyatt also called Cosby\u2019s trial that resulted in a conviction \u201cthe most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States,\u201d saying that Cosby was \u201cone of the greatest civil rights leaders\u201d and a \u201cgreat educator of men and boys.\u201d He also criticized the psychologists who testified against Cosby, and claimed that audio footage of Cosby played in the courtroom was falsified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a particularly bizarre moment, Wyatt referenced the persecution of Jesus while talking about Cosby. \u201cThey persecuted Jesus and look what happened,\u201d he said, according to CNN. \u201cNot saying Mr. Cosby\u2019s Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bill Cosby's publicist, Andrew Wyatt, claims both Cosby and Brett Kavanaugh are victims of \"a sex war\" that is \"going on in Washington today.\" pic.twitter.com/jRHOjzUZD7 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wyatt has repeatedly argued that racism played a role in Cosby\u2019s conviction in not-so-subtle terms, calling the April trial a \u201cpublic lynching.\u201d Other members of Cosby\u2019s team have invoked Emmett Till, a black boy murdered after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it was the first time that Cosby\u2019s team has made a connection to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination has been embroiled in controversy after two women accused him of sexual assault and misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1980s. Christine Blasey Ford came forward earlier this month to accuse him of attempted rape during a high school party in the \u201980s. She is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sunday, a second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, stepped forward with her own story of sexual misconduct on Sunday, saying that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a college party. Both accusers have called for the FBI to investigate their claims before a vote on Kavanaugh takes place, but contrary to Wyatt\u2019s claims, there\u2019s a strong chance Kavanaugh could be confirmed anyway.\nPassage 3:\nEMBED More News Videos Bill Cosby heads to Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Eagleville.

He will be allowed phone calls and visitation in accordance with policy, as well as opportunity to exercise during the classification process.\"We are taking all of the necessary precautions to ensure Mr. Cosby's safety and general welfare in our institution,\" Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said in a statement. \"The long term goal is for him to be placed in the general population to receive the programming required during his incarceration.\"Cosby spent a few hours at the county jail Tuesday before heading to SCI Phoenix which opened two months ago. His inmate number with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections is NN7687.Prosecutors said correction officials would assess Cosby's needs and safety issues to determine where it would be best for the 81-year-old Cosby, who is legally blind, to complete his sentence.District Attorney Kevin Steele had said Cosby could wind up at SCI Laurel Highlands, a prison for lower-risk inmates on the other side of the state, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Pittsburgh.SCI Laurel Highlands is the state Correction Department's provider to inmates with special needs, including those requiring long-term care, though it also houses a general prison population, according to its website. It has separate housing units for its geriatric inmates and also has programs for sex offenders, the website says. Cosby was declared a \"sexually violent predator' just before his sentencing, requiring him to receive monthly counseling the rest of his life. The prison at Laurel Highlands opened in 1996, at the site of a former state hospital. At last count it held nearly 1,600 inmates.However, it was confirmed on Wednesday morning, Cosby would serve his sentence at SCI Phoenix.------\n",

                "Bill Cosby was labeled a \"violent sexual predator\" by the judge who sentenced him to three to 10 years in prison on Tuesday, but his publicist had a different description: one of the \"greatest civil rights leaders\" in history and one of the \"greatest educators of men and boys.\" Outside the courtroom in Norristown, Pa., publicist Andrew Wyatt claimed the 81-year-old Cosby had faced the \"most racist and sexist trial\" in American history, the New York Times reports. Wyatt claimed that three psychologists who testified against Cosby in the sexual assault trial were trying to \"make money off of accusing black men of being sexual predators.\" He also read a statement from Camille Cosby, the disgraced entertainer's wife, alleging that an audio recording played in the trial had been doctored. Wyatt, who previously called Cosby's trial a \"public lynching,\" accused Judge Steven O'Neill of being part of a \"sex war\" and linked the sentencing to the treatment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Vox reports that the strangest moment came when Wyatt likened his client to Jesus. \"They persecuted Jesus, and look what happened,\" he said. \"Not saying Mr. Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.\" Cosby, who left the Montgomery County Courthouse in handcuffs, spent his first night behind bars at SCI Phoenix, a state prison that opened two months ago in suburban Philadelphia, reports WPVI.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The situation doesn't represent a life-threatening emergency, but it has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost, NASA spokesman Josh Byerly said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The crew was never in any danger,\" he said. \"They're fine for the near future.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem is one of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face on an occasional basis during space station operations. \"This is the kind of thing that they expected to happen, at about the expected rate,\" NBC News space analyst James Oberg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shutdown mode NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down when it reached a pre-set temperature limit on Wednesday, Byerly told NBC News. That forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B. As a result, the station's six-person crew had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems and science experiments \u2014 including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab and Europe's Columbus lab. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crew \"worked to keep the freezers going, \" Byerly said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Engineers think the problem was caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Mission managers are trying to determine whether a software fix can get the valve working again, or whether a spacewalk will be required. Sorting through all the issues might take a couple of days, or as much as a couple of weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Routine maintenance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It generally takes two weeks to plan for a \"Big 14\" repair operation, but that depends on the resources at hand and the urgency of the problem. In May, NASA astronauts mounted a spacewalk to replace a leaky coolant pump control box after just two days of planning. Spacewalkers also dealt with coolant system maintenance issues in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2007. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. spacewalks were temporarily suspended after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's spacesuit filled with water during a July outing, but Russian spacewalks have proceeded without problems.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are cleared for a contingency spacewalk if we need to do one,\" NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told NBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Americans, three Russians and a Japanese astronaut are living on the space station, which has been continuously occupied since 2000 by spacefliers who spend tours of duty generally lasting four to six months. The current plan calls for the space station to be maintained through 2020, although the United States and the 14 other countries supporting the $100 billion-plus station project are already considering extending its operating life.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pump on one of the station's two external cooling loops shut down after hitting a temperature limit, NASA said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the midst of appreciating the weather and scenery, she looked ahead and noticed a raccoon obstructing the narrow foot path, baring its tiny teeth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suddenly, it began \u201cbounding\u201d toward her, Borch recalled Wednesday afternoon during an interview at her home on Hatchet Mountain Road in Hope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI knew instantly it had to be rabid,\u201d said Borch, who remembers ripping out her headphones and dropping her phone on the ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What felt like a split second later, the furry animal was at her feet. Borch said she was \u201cdancing around it,\u201d trying to figure out what to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cImagine the Tasmanian devil,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The path was too narrow for Borch to run past the raccoon, which had begun lunging at her. With adrenaline pumping, Borch suspended her disbelief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI knew it was going to bite me,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Figuring she would have the greatest ability to defend herself if she used her hands to hold it down, she decided that probably would be the best place for the aggressive animal to latch on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The raccoon sank its teeth into Borch\u2019s thumb and \u201cwouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d Its paws were scratching her arms and legs wildly as Borch screamed and cried. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a matter of seconds, Borch, who could not unhinge the raccoon\u2019s jaw to shake it off her hand, noticed that when she had dropped her phone, it had fallen into a puddle in the path and was fully submerged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could strangle [the raccoon] with my bare hands,\u201d she remembers thinking, but holding it under the water might do the trick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Connecting the dots quickly, Borch, then on her knees, dragged the still biting raccoon, which was scratching frantically at her hand and arms, into the puddle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWith my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,\u201d Borch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the animal belly-up, she held its head under water. \u201cIt was still struggling and clawing at my arms. It wouldn\u2019t let go of my thumb,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch said she held it there for what felt like an eternity until finally it stopped struggling and \u201cits arms sort of of fell to the side, its chest still heaving really slowly.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperventilating and in hysterics, she pulled her thumb out of the raccoon\u2019s mouth, \u201cand then I just bolted as fast as I could through the underbrush,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch remembers looking back once to see if the raccoon had started chasing her again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt felt like [Stephen King\u2019s] \u2018Pet Sematary,\u2019\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kicking her shoes off because they were soaked, Borch ran the three-quarters of a mile home to her house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch, who was screaming and unsure of how rabies affects humans, remembers thinking, \u201cOh, God, what if I just start foaming at the mouth and can\u2019t find my way back?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She met her mother, Elizabeth, at home, and together they drove immediately to Pen Bay Medical Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dead raccoon was retrieved by Borch\u2019s dad, who packed it into a Taste of the Wild dog food bag and handed it over to the Maine Warden Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hope Animal Control Officer Heidi Blood confirmed Wednesday that the dead raccoon later tested positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cNot to scare people,\u201d Blood said, but \u201cwhen there\u2019s one [infected], there\u2019s typically another.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s important to \u201clet folks know that just because there\u2019s one [infected] and it\u2019s gone now, doesn\u2019t mean the risk still isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Infected animals typically start showing signs within two weeks, Blood said. Humans can start exhibiting symptoms within a few weeks, she said, but often it takes a few months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s scary stuff,\u201d Blood said. \u201cThe No. 1 thing we try to remind people of is that it\u2019s 100 percent fatal [if it goes untreated].\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch has received six shots so far, including the rabies vaccine, and immunoglobulin and tetanus injections.

I\u2019ve never killed an animal with my bare hands. I\u2019m a vegetarian. It was self-defense.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her advice for others who find themselves facing a rabid animal?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2016, 64 animals in Maine tested positive for rabies, according to CDC data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Loading\u2026\nPassage 2:\nHOPE \u2014 A woman who was attacked by a rabid raccoon while running in the woods near her home drowned the animal in a puddle after it latched onto her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rachel Borch, 21, said she was getting ready to go out for an afternoon run on June 3 when her brother Chris told her to be careful because he had seen a raccoon \u201cskulking\u201d around the yard. He told her he thought it odd that the raccoon, normally a nocturnal animal, was out in the daytime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch said she was running on a fire road next to her house when she encountered the animal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cOut of nowhere, I see through the underbrush a very ferocious-looking raccoon charging at me with its teeth bared,\u201d Borch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She immediately knew something was wrong with the animal by the way it was acting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt was one of those moments like out of the \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 \u2013 this isn\u2019t real, this doesn\u2019t happen in real life, but then it was right there and it was right at my feet,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch said she started dancing around the animal, frantically trying to figure out what to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere was nothing I could do, it was going to bite me,\u201d she said. She had dropped her phone and had nothing to protect herself with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She figured that if it was going to bite her, it might as well be her hands. She put her hands out in front of her, and the raccoon latched onto her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI was screaming and crying and trying to hold it down,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a few inches of really muddy water on the ground \u2013 it was a swampy area of the trail \u2013 so I just took all my strength and pushed it into the water.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she pushed the raccoon\u2019s head underwater and held it there for what seemed like a very long time as it clawed her arms and continued to bite down on her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt happened so fast, but also in slow motion,\u201d Borch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed June 5 that the raccoon tested positive for rabies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabies is caused by a virus, affects the brain and spinal cord and can cause death if left untreated, according to the Maine CDC. Rabies in people is very rare in the United States, but rabies in animals \u2013 especially wildlife \u2013 is common in most parts of the country, including Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The raccoon continued to move for a while while Borch kept its head underwater. She said she was afraid to let go for fear it would continue attacking her. Eventually, it released its paws and its jaws stopped clenching her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bleeding and crying, Borch ran home and screamed for her mother to call 911. Borch\u2019s father, Brad, and her brother retrieved the animal so another animal wouldn\u2019t drag it off and become infected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hope animal control officer Heidi Blood said that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it\u2019s \u201calmost 100 percent\u201d certain there are other animals in the area also infected. Blood said that last summer, two raccoons in Lincolnville and one in Hope tested positive for rabies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blood said an animal doesn\u2019t have to be aggressive to be infected; it can also act \u201cdelirious or drunklike.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said people and their pets should avoid such animals, even dead ones, because the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch is expected to receive the last of four rabies shots on Saturday, and has been taking antibiotics for the puncture wounds on her hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou just can\u2019t predict something like that,\u201d Borch said. \u201cI\u2019m still processing it, but that does not happen and that is not a normal thing.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Share NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Want the news vital to Maine?

Borch, 21, knew immediately that something was wrong with the raccoon that was charging toward her. \"Imagine the Tasmanian devil,\" she tells the Bangor Daily News of the \"terrifying\" June 3 incident. Yanking out her headphones, she began \"dancing\" around the animal on the narrow path, but she tells the Herald she knew that, one way or another, the animal was going to bite her. She figured her hands would be the best spot, so she offered them up. The raccoon chomped down on her thumb and stayed there, scratching at her legs and arms as she screamed. Now on her knees, she spotted her phone lying submerged in a mud puddle, and had an idea: drown it. \"With my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,\" she tells the News. When the raccoon finally stopped moving, she yanked out her finger and raced the three-quarters of a mile home. Two days later, the state confirmed the animal was infected with rabies. Borch got rabies shots, and an animal control officer adds an unpleasant footnote: The infected raccoon may not be alone. \"Not to scare people,\" Heidi Blood tells the News, but \"when there\u2019s one, there\u2019s typically another.\" (Normally nocturnal like raccoons, a crazed beaver attacked a woman paddle-boarder.)"

Gunshots could still be heard in the Malian capital late Wednesday, hours after angry... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gunfire could be heard ringing throughout the capital, and the mutinous soldiers imposed a nationwide curfew. A flight headed to the capital of Bamako was forced to make a U-turn in the air after the airport closed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The soldiers said they are overthrowing the government because of its mishandling of an ethnic Tuareg insurgency in the country's north that began in mid-January. The rebellion grew when fighters who had supported the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi returned home heavily armed. The unrest has forced tens of thousands to flee, and has prompted fierce criticism of Mali's government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Thursday, a group of around 20 soldiers in military fatigues were shown on national television crowding around a desk, facing the camera. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They announced that Mali is now under the control of the military's National Committee for the Reestablishment of Democracy and the Restoration of the State, or CNRDR. They said they were suspending Mali's constitution and dissolving its institutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The soldiers complained that the civilian government had not done enough to combat a rebellion by the ethnic Tuareg separatists, who want to carve out a homeland in the country's northern desert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The CNRDR representing all the elements of the armed forces, defensive forces and security forces has decided to assume its responsibilities and end the incompetent and disavowed regime of (President) Amadou Toumani Toure,\" they said, reading from a statement. \"The objective of the CNRDR does not in any way aim to confiscate power, and we solemnly swear to return power to a democratically elected president as soon as national unity and territorial integrity are established.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The West African regional bloc ECOWAS said it \"strongly condemns the misguided actions of the mutineers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group said it was \"all the more reprehensible, coming amidst the ongoing regional and international efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the rebellion in the north of the country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The coup is a major setback for one of the region's few established democracies. The ousted president came to power himself in a 1991 coup, but was hailed for handing power to civilians. A decade later, he won the 2002 democratic election. The 63-year-old Toure was due to step down next month after two, five-year terms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His whereabouts were unknown on Thursday. Contacted by telephone, a soldier at the palace said that the president's bodyguards had failed to fight the renegade soldiers, who burst in. They searched the grounds looking for him, but could not find Toure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The events that culminated in the coup began Wednesday morning at a military camp in the capital, where Defense Minister Gen. Sadio Gassama came for an official visit. In his speech to the troops, the minister failed to address the grievances of the rank-and-file soldiers. The rebellion has claimed the lives of numerous soldiers, and those sent to fight say they are not given sufficient supplies, including arms or food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recruits started firing into the air Wednesday morning. By afternoon, troops had surrounded the state television station in central Bamako, located in southwest Mali, yanking both the television and radio signals off the air for the rest of the day. By Wednesday evening, troops had started rioting at a military garrison located in the northern town of Gao, some 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A freelance journalist from Sweden who was driving to her hotel near the TV station around 4 p.m. Wednesday said that trucks full of soldiers had surrounded the state broadcaster, where they set up machine guns facing the building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They came and started setting up checkpoints.

There are reports of military forces surrounding the presidential palace and movement of vehicles between the palace and the military barracks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tuaregs, a traditionally nomadic people spread across the Sahara Desert, have risen up against the central government in Mali several times since the country's independence from France in 1960. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newest rebellion launched in mid-January broke years of relative peace, and has been fueled by the return of Tuaregs from Libya who had fought in Gadhafi's army. Refugees have spilled over into four of the countries neighboring Mali due to the uprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thousands of Tuaregs moved from Mali to Libya over the decades beginning in the 1970s, and many joined special divisions of Gadhafi's military where they earned higher salaries than in Mali. A relationship developed between the Tuareg and Gadhafi, who claimed they had distant blood links. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Gadhafi regime fell last year, Tuareg troops smuggled Gadhafi family members to neighboring Algeria and Niger. After Gadhafi was killed in his hometown of Sirte in October, many Tuaregs no longer felt safe in Libya and began returning to Mali.

And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably .

Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the {disfmarker} from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .\nGrad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .\nGrad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we {disfmarker} we worked around that . The , uh {disfmarker} the system , um {disfmarker} I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was {disfmarker} It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .\nGrad D: Why {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in {disfmarker} in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,\nGrad E: You have to switch it on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the {disfmarker} built the tree .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad B: Like .\nProfessor C: So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: um\nGrad B: I {disfmarker} I still don't {disfmarker} I still don't really understand e like {disfmarker}\nGrad D: Well Tilman s\nGrad B: I mean we sort of say , um {disfmarker} You know , I {disfmarker} I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in {disfmarker} in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s\nProfessor C: Yeah {disfmarker}\nGrad B: I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?\nProfessor C: I thi Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,\nGrad B: R uh Sure .\nProfessor C: but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .\nGrad B: Yeah , soon . OK .\nProfessor C: And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .\nGrad B: That 's fine .\nProfessor C: It 's eee {comment} messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} There 's nothing really complicated about it .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: No .\nGrad B: And I remember one thing that {disfmarker} that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I {disfmarker} I think he talked about the idea of like , um {disfmarker} He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of {disfmarker} for each word you , um {disfmarker}\nGrad D: OK , you know how to do it ?\nGrad B: For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's HPSG or whatever .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: You know ?\nProfessor C: Right . Now , we 're {disfmarker} we 're not committed for our research to {pause} do any of those things .\nGrad B: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So uh we are committed for our funding .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: OK ? to {pause} uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Make our stuff fit to that .\nProfessor C: Yeah , to {disfmarker} n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .\nGrad D: You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts\nGrad D: There 's like a little {disfmarker} The twisty thing , you can move it with .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and , s deliberately . So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just for closure . So that if we come up with a question of \" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? \" or something . You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? But none of that has a short time fuse .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . And then {disfmarker} So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .\nGrad B: Oh OK .\nProfessor C: That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: but it means we can not think about it for six months .\nGrad B: Right , yeah .\nProfessor C: So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor C: keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .\nGrad B: Hmm . Oh OK .\nProfessor C: And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other {disfmarker} anything lik any other constraints for the time being .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK . Got it .\nProfessor C: It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then {disfmarker} and get the constructions in their form and stuff .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .\nGrad B: Right , OK .\nProfessor C: Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case you know , construction parser for general constructions . And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .\nGrad B: So I mean , the {disfmarker} the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been {disfmarker} sort of been geared towards this demo ,\nProfessor C: Right . Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad B: and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .\nProfessor C: But {disfmarker} but we we 're swit\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad B: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: huh ?\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad E: It 's got . What I {disfmarker} what I think is {disfmarker} is a good idea that I can {disfmarker} can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a {disfmarker} sort of an internal demo , and I {disfmarker} I show you what I do ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I speak into it and you hear it talk ,\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And so you {disfmarker} when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? Just give a talk in the big room , and {disfmarker} and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing {disfmarker} That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say \" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it \" and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK . Well d we {disfmarker} we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: Indeed .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . Makes sense .\nProfessor C: But any so that {disfmarker} e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where {disfmarker} Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in {disfmarker} Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can {disfmarker} can see what {disfmarker} what it is that {disfmarker} that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .\nGrad B: Yeah . OK , right .\nProfessor C: And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the {disfmarker} looked at the SmartKom stuff .\nGrad D: Wa uh {disfmarker} To some de uh what {disfmarker} what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?\nProfessor C: Well , the parser , and that stuff .\nGrad D: Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . Anyway . So , the trip {disfmarker} the report on these {disfmarker} the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .\nGrad B: Yeah . It 's alright .\nGrad E: Um . {vocalsound} Well it was just amazing to {disfmarker} to see uh how {disfmarker} how instable the whole thing is ,\nProfessor C: Maybe you 're done , then .\nGrad E: and if you just take the {disfmarker} And I g I got the feeling that we are {pause} the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version {disfmarker} that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's {disfmarker} And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system {disfmarker} the integration group . And it was , uh {disfmarker} It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman {disfmarker} um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they {disfmarker} they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what {disfmarker} what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to {disfmarker} to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and {disfmarker} and generating and constructions w we {disfmarker} we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh {disfmarker} If I find someone at {disfmarker} in EML that is interested in that , um I {disfmarker} I may even think that we could look {disfmarker} take constructions and {disfmarker} and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that {disfmarker} that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .\nProfessor C: Anyth - any other {vocalsound} {comment} uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we {disfmarker} so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: And so we just push on and {disfmarker} and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight {disfmarker} tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is {disfmarker} {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh {disfmarker} hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all {disfmarker} you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is {disfmarker} is that right ? I mean that 's {disfmarker} that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?\nGrad E: Absolutely .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad G: So , I guess , um {disfmarker} Is there like a latest version of the belief - net {disfmarker} of the proposed belief - net ? Like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: We had um decided {disfmarker}\nGrad G: like {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .\nGrad G: Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine .\nProfessor C: Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .\nGrad D: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor C: That 's separable , yeah .\nGrad D: I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag\nProfessor C: Yep . Right .\nGrad D: JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,\nProfessor C: Not {disfmarker} not at this point .\nGrad D: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,\nProfessor C: Right .\nGrad D: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .\nProfessor C: Well , we can p If it 's {disfmarker} If we can pay {disfmarker} Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So {disfmarker} so don't view free as {disfmarker} as a absolute constraint .\nGrad D: OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: OK . And you can ask Kevin .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: But {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ?\nProfessor C: Hugin , yeah that 's free .\nGrad G: How exp I don't think it 's {disfmarker} Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I {disfmarker} it seems to {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I {disfmarker} I don't know . I have a co {comment} I have a copy {comment} that I l I downloaded .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: So , at one point it was free .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,\nGrad D: How do you spell that ?\nProfessor C: HUGIN .\nGrad F: Why\nProfessor C: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um {disfmarker} But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh {disfmarker} Probably for university , it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in changing the {disfmarker} the JavaBayes code .\nProfessor C: No ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: he 's not gonna do that .\nGrad D: OK .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You {disfmarker} you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we {disfmarker} we need to solve right now . What I 'm {disfmarker} what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of {disfmarker} of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all\nGrad G: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Doesn't matter .\nGrad G: Um , just any like {disfmarker} like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .\nGrad E: OK . And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ?\nGrad G: Yeah {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , I can {disfmarker} like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of {disfmarker} I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might {disfmarker} I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .\nGrad E: Yeah . OK .\nProfessor C: Yeah and this is not a crisis that {disfmarker} I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and then we 'll dig {disfmarker} d dig down on this .\nGrad E: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So .\nGrad G: OK .\nGrad B: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Right . Well there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there There 're two different things you do .\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is {disfmarker} is do design , and , i if you will , guess .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of {disfmarker} of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .\nGrad B: Right . OK .\nProfessor C: If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .\nGrad B: Alright .\nGrad E: Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So but this is the {pause} {vocalsound} {comment} {pause} long run .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .\nGrad B: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore {disfmarker} uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a {disfmarker} um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the {disfmarker} with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to {disfmarker} to look at what {disfmarker} look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and {disfmarker} and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get .\nGrad E: The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one .\nGrad E: OK . That 's important , yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: So he 'll get you some data .\nGrad B: u OK . Yeah , I mean I {disfmarker} I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nGrad B: It was just {disfmarker} Strange , but .\nProfessor C: Yep .\nGrad E: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .\nGrad B: Oh yeah , OK .\nGrad E: Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .\nGrad B: OK , yeah , I mean .\nGrad E: So . {disfmarker} Transcribed . I will send you that . OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?\nGrad E: Ho - how was your thingy .\nGrad B: Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,\nProfessor C: Oh right .\nGrad B: and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh {disfmarker} to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was {disfmarker} the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction {disfmarker} he 'd {disfmarker} what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in {disfmarker} in Japanese the {disfmarker} the more conventionalized tendency is to use a {disfmarker} sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um {disfmarker} But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to {disfmarker} uh , to indicate where something is .\nProfessor C: Mmm .\nGrad B: So we 'll have to think about {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: So {disfmarker} how much is that used in German ?\nGrad E: Um . The uh {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} I wa I was on a uh {disfmarker} on a {disfmarker} on a different sidetrack .\nProfessor C: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: I mean , the {disfmarker} the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at {disfmarker} at the moment , but this is a {disfmarker} a three language project : German , English , Japanese .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , we have a uh , uh {disfmarker} I have taken care that we have the {disfmarker} the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And {disfmarker} and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh {disfmarker} differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how {disfmarker} how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: So . Um .\nProfessor C: So , where is this huge project ?\nGrad E: It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: \nProfessor C: Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: But um , I {disfmarker} I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for {disfmarker} for now ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad E: but um definitely it 's interesting to look at {disfmarker} at cross the bordered there .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Are {disfmarker} are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the direction relative {disfmarker} relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car . In Hebrew it means \" park behind the car \" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Intrinsic , yeah .\nPhD A: While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So .\nGrad B: Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nGrad B: OK .\nPhD A: So , i i i is German uh closer to {disfmarker} to E uh , uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} to E I mean uh\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I don't think it {disfmarker} it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different .\nGrad E: Um , as a matter of fact {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: No , it 's not .\nGrad B: Right .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad E: Um . Did you ever get to look at the {disfmarker} the rou paper that I sent you on the {disfmarker} on that problem in English and German ?\nGrad B: I think {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Carroll , ninety - three . Um . I {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad E: So it 's {disfmarker} they actually say \" the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that {disfmarker} that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .\nPhD A: That {disfmarker} but it wasn't {disfmarker} was {disfmarker}\nGrad E: That syntactic facto factors do {disfmarker} do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames .\nPhD A: Right . Mm - hmm . Right .\nGrad B: I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in {disfmarker} in English depending o\nProfessor C: Hmm .\nGrad B: You know , like , \" in front of the car \" could you know {disfmarker} Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that ,\nProfessor C: Absolutely .\nGrad B: but {disfmarker} But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was {disfmarker} this was a {disfmarker} a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh .\nGrad E: I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the {disfmarker} the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .\nGrad B: Alright ! Cool !\nGrad E: So .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .\nProfessor C: Oh .\nGrad E: Not really .\nProfessor C: Great . No , I 've not seen that .\nPhD A: What do you mean . Um . \" reference frames \" ?\nGrad E: It 's called a {disfmarker}\nPhD A: uh uh\nGrad E: It 's {disfmarker} it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only {disfmarker} Um . If you wanna have a {disfmarker} This is usually um {disfmarker} I should {disfmarker} there should be an \" L \" , though . Well actually you have {disfmarker} only have two choices . You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the \" origo \" ? where that 's the center {disfmarker} \" Origo \" is the center of the f frame of reference .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nGrad E: And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .\nGrad B: Hmm .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: OK ? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .\nProfessor C: So that would be \" origin \" in English ,\nGrad F: This was like {disfmarker}\nGrad B: The origin .\nPhD A: Right\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: right ?\nGrad E: \" Origo \" is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , that 's even used in the English literature . \" Origo . \"\nGrad B: Oh , OK . I never heard it .\nProfessor C: Alright .\nPhD A: OK .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , so , this video tape is in front of me .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Right .\nGrad E: Those are two - point .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , reference object and {disfmarker} Um . No , from {disfmarker} from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair .\nGrad B: Right . You {disfmarker} you can actually say things like , um , \" it 's behind the tree from me \" or something like that , I think , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . So ,\nGrad F: Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time .\nProfessor C: Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: yeah .\nGrad F: It 's a lot like it .\nGrad E: And then {disfmarker} and then here you {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Um .\nGrad E: On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And that 's {comment} {disfmarker} that 's basically it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad E: So , \" as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station \" . aa - huh {comment} It 's hardly ever used but it 's w\nPhD A: I 'd love to see it if you {disfmarker} if you have a copy kind of . Uh .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . I see this is {disfmarker} this is getting into Ami 's thing .\nPhD A: Here\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: He 's {disfmarker} he 's very interested in that .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: So .\nGrad B: Me too .\nProfessor C: Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU {disfmarker} Right ?\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor C: Or a link to it .\nGrad E: It 's also all on my {disfmarker} my home page at EML . It 's called \" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description \" .\nProfessor C: Just\nGrad E: But I 'll send that link .\nPhD A: OK , great .\nProfessor C: Maybe just put a link on . Yeah .\nGrad E: Yep .\nProfessor C: By the way , there {disfmarker} something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .\nGrad E: Yep .\nGrad B: Huh .\nProfessor C: So there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: So this is all {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , the {disfmarker} Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . That , you know they do MRI , and {disfmarker} and if you 're uh {disfmarker} got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . But here 's the {disfmarker} the amazing result , um , they say . You get someone with a {disfmarker} with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a {disfmarker} a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , \" Where 's the midpoint ? \" And they do fine . If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't . There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that . Here 's the real experiment . The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , \" where is it ? \" ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say \" do it \" , they can't do it . So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .\nPhD A: Right . So they doubled {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end of this {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Because it 's within reach now ?\nGrad B: Yeah ,\nProfessor C: It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism .\nGrad B: yeah .\nGrad F: Oh . Wow .\nGrad B: Circuits .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And so this doe This is , uh {disfmarker} First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this {disfmarker} this test on you guys as well . So . Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . Not indirectly , but you actually can feel the tip .\nGrad B: Yeah yeah .\nProfessor C: And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector .\nGrad B: Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool ,\nPhD A: The ext the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} The extension ,\nGrad B: yeah .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nGrad B: What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever .\nProfessor C: Yeah , within {disfmarker}\nPhD A: right .\nProfessor C: Huh ?\nPhD A: The extension of {disfmarker} of your hand , right .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ?\nPhD A: The {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but {disfmarker} but s it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's getting close to that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nGrad F: W what does it feel like ?\nProfessor C: Oh i it feels like your {disfmarker} as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and {disfmarker} and you deal directly with it .\nPhD A: I once {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? So you can insert your hand something\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nProfessor C: Right , yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: and there 's a correspondence between {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So I played with it . After a while , you don't feel the difference anymore . I {disfmarker} I mean it 's kind of {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Yeah , right .\nPhD A: Very {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker} you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Right , Yeah , so anyway , so {disfmarker} So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff .\nGrad B: That 's cool .\nProfessor C: And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . And i this is , um {disfmarker} So . In addition to the e\nGrad E: This is more proximal - distal .\nProfessor C: Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . S\nGrad E: Well , Dan Montello sort of , he {disfmarker} he does the uh uh {disfmarker} th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . And he {disfmarker} he always talks about these {disfmarker} He {disfmarker} he already {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} i probably most likely without knowing this {disfmarker} this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Well there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . Anyway yeah , so we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll look at this . And . So , all of these issues now {disfmarker} are now starting to come up . So , now {disfmarker} we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about uh , reference , and {disfmarker} spatial {comment} reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh {comment} all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: um {disfmarker} So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . So \" OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . \"\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Right ?\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: It {disfmarker} it follows . And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , so , um {disfmarker} And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , \" is there an ontology API that {disfmarker} that \" {disfmarker} There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so {disfmarker} For example , is there something that we can use there . i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . Uh , so there are gonna be some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some things like that , which are not science but system . But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're {disfmarker} we 're not only going {disfmarker} The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . And how much we build , and {disfmarker} and so forth .\nGrad B: I {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: It was just this uh construction analyzer . And so we think {disfmarker} we think we have a shot at {disfmarker} at that .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So . The for So . To {disfmarker} to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into {disfmarker} into a shape where it can actually uh\nGrad B: Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?\nProfessor C: d Well , yeah , where it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} covers the whole range of things . And the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: And it just {disfmarker} it was just terribly frustrating for him ,\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .\nGrad B: I see . Right .\nProfessor C: And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .\nGrad B: OK . Good to know .\nProfessor C: Uh . Huh ? Is {disfmarker} This is true , is it not ?\nGrad D: Yes .\nProfessor C: OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .\nGrad B: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: You don't have a hidden purist streak ?\nGrad D: Oh no .\nProfessor C: We - well it hasn't it {disfmarker} it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .\nGrad F: OK . Just checking .\nGrad D: No sir .\nGrad B: Alright .\nProfessor C: Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Cuz I don't have to implement anything .\nProfessor C: Exactly right . Exactly .\nGrad F: I have a problem , then . It 's {disfmarker} So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad B: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: Right . Why {disfmarker} a actually , uh , the thing is , you {disfmarker} you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that {disfmarker} Uh .\nGrad F: Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context .\nProfessor C: Within that , yeah ,\nGrad F: Yes ,\nProfessor C: and uh , it 's {disfmarker} a and still , I think , you know , get something done .\nGrad F: good .\nGrad B: Cool !\nProfessor C: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if {disfmarker} if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , {vocalsound} is real hard .\nGrad F: Yay .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor C: OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,\nPhD A: It 's possible yeah .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that {disfmarker} that you can just , in Germany {disfmarker} almost just send in your thesis .\nGrad B: Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !\nPhD A: Um\nProfessor C: Yeah right .\nGrad B: There you go .\nProfessor C: OK .\nGrad E: The - th There {disfmarker} there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh {vocalsound} joint over in Saarbruecken .\nGrad B: Exactly . Drive through , yeah .\nProfessor C: It costs a lot . The {disfmarker} the amount {disfmarker} You put in your credit card and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as well . But , uh , {disfmarker} But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that {disfmarker} that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: It really is . Nobody believed th th that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nGrad F: like {disfmarker} {comment} \" Johno made it up , I 'm sure . \"\nGrad G: Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year ,\nProfessor C: No , first year coming .\nGrad G: or\nProfessor C: So , she 's {disfmarker} she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of then .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .\nGrad G: OK .\nProfessor C: Uh .\nGrad E: Document .\nGrad G: Right .\nProfessor C: Uh , against all traditions . And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Someone from the class ?\nProfessor C: No , interestingly enough .\nGrad F: We always get these people who are not in the class , who {disfmarker}\nProfessor C: Some of th some of them , yeah .\nGrad F: It 's interesting .\nProfessor C: So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first {disfmarker} {comment} incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,\nPhD A: OK .\nProfessor C: so uh and ,\nPhD A: Right\nProfessor C: I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the {disfmarker} your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .\nGrad B: Sure .\nProfessor C: I suspect that 's right .\nGrad B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A: I {disfmarker} I may have to go to Switzerland for {disfmarker} in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that .\nProfessor C: OK , fine . And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in {disfmarker} in the neighborhood .\nPhD A: Right . Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Yep . E o do y\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Well , we we 're connected to uh {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a very significant connection between {disfmarker} We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll go through this ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh {disfmarker} It 's the {disfmarker} Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in {disfmarker} in Zurich ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,\nGrad B: Oh , so in Switzerland .\nProfessor C: OK ? which is uh E P\nPhD A: Great .\nProfessor C: F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .\nPhD A: Right .\nProfessor C: Probably we 're connected to them .\nPhD A: Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email .\nProfessor C: OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh {disfmarker} We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Hmm . Uh . I {disfmarker} I think the one you {disfmarker} you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .\nPhD A: Sure , yeah .\nProfessor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so , and {disfmarker} and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .\nPhD A: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .\nPhD A: Great , yeah .\nProfessor C: Cuz they 've actually {disfmarker} these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up .\nPhD A: Cool .\nProfessor C: OK . So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the {disfmarker} uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably {disfmarker}\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .\nProfessor C: OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" . And that we as a group will try to {disfmarker} to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .\nGrad G: Sure .\nProfessor C: OK ? Uh , \" these are the decisions \" {disfmarker} I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor C: You know . We {disfmarker}\nGrad G: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Does that so make sense ?\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad E: And um , the {disfmarker} the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?\nGrad G: No , I {disfmarker} I think I 'll be done {disfmarker} everything by this uh {disfmarker} by the end of this week .\nGrad E: Same with you ? No .\nGrad D: Nnn . This {disfmarker} Well , I 've {disfmarker} I have projects , but then the {disfmarker} my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?\nGrad D: Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah .\nProfessor C: Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess .\nGrad G: Hmm .\nProfessor C: Right . Um , But anyway , yeah .\nGrad B: Pretty soon .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor C: OK , so I guess that 's\nGrad D: So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .\nProfessor C: Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B: OK .\nProfessor C: Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,\nGrad B: Right .\nProfessor C: right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .\nGrad E: Mmm .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa\nGrad B: Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah .\nProfessor C: We {disfmarker} we want those ,\nGrad B: Yeah , oh yeah .\nProfessor C: right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that .\nGrad B: Yeah .\nProfessor C: So let me {disfmarker} let me make a note to do that .\nGrad B: OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer ,\nGrad D: OK .\nProfessor C: Oh right ! Right right right !\nGrad B: so .\nProfessor C: That 's great ! Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: Hi\nGrad B: Right , no faculty !\nProfessor C: Th - the faculty aren't {disfmarker} faculty aren't supposed to know .\nGrad D: Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .\nProfessor C: But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a {disfmarker}\nGrad B: Yeah , right . It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,\nGrad D: Bhaskara .\nGrad B: right .",

And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: until here or something .\nMarketing: Yes .\nUser Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nUser Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very obvious .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer: The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing: Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , six .\nMarketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , true or false .\nMarketing: And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry .\nProject Manager: You ?\nUser Interface: Three .\nProject Manager: Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface: Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nUser Interface: Mm , four .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think it's four .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: but\nProject Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface: older {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . Two .\nProject Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Then make it th three .\nMarketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager: No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Say two .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface: One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Me too . One .\nMarketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager: No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It won't .\nProject Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager: Okay , a one .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: Next .\nMarketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager: That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yes , a one .\nProject Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Two is okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm , three .\nProject Manager: Me too . Three .\nMarketing: A three .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing: So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing: By nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's good .\nMarketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager: Yep . Next please .\nMarketing: Next . Finance .\nProject Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer: Expensive .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface: Mm , yes .\nProject Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager: So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer: What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager: Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing: {gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer: A special colour .\nProject Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing: For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager: That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager: Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} .",

Oh , oh , you mean the {disfmarker} the quals .\nPhD A: The quals . Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .\nPhD A: Oh . Soon .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Uh - huh .\nGrad F: D - Day .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um {disfmarker} then everybody asks you questions .\nPhD A: Hmm .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: I remember now .\nGrad F: Yep . So , um .\nPhD A: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any {disfmarker} a little bit about it ,\nGrad F: Y s\nPhD A: or {disfmarker} ? Mmm .\nGrad F: Oh . Uh , a little bit about {disfmarker} ?\nPhD A: Wh - what you 're {disfmarker} what you 're gonna {disfmarker} You said {disfmarker} you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at ,\nGrad F: Oh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A: or {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features {disfmarker} in intermediate categories to {disfmarker} to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with {disfmarker} with a reasonable set . Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would {disfmarker} that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then {disfmarker} and then {vocalsound} reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new {disfmarker} or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again .\nPhD A: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?\nGrad F: Um , for that {disfmarker} for that part of the {disfmarker} the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: And , um , then {disfmarker} after {disfmarker} after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ?\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Um , that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's , um {disfmarker} that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd {disfmarker} I would be able to , um {disfmarker} to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on {disfmarker} on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that {disfmarker} for that part I would {disfmarker} I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for {disfmarker} for Switchboard . And I 'd run some {disfmarker} some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers .\nPhD A: Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files .\nGrad F: Yeah . That 's why I {disfmarker} I was asking about that .\nPhD A: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's {disfmarker} that 's it . Any {disfmarker} any questions ?\nPhD A: Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ?\nGrad F: Um , yeah . A few more .\nPhD A: It 's about a month from now ?\nGrad F: It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a month and {disfmarker} and a week .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we {disfmarker} we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , {vocalsound} six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , {vocalsound} considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK {disfmarker} sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um {disfmarker} This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel {pause} normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the {disfmarker} Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts {pause} in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have {pause} different phones {pause} lined up with a different foreground phone , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} depending on {pause} the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um {disfmarker} Hmm .\nProfessor B: I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about {disfmarker} we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that {disfmarker} some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy {pause} sections ? Um , uh , if you {disfmarker} if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in {pause} late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a {disfmarker} an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what {disfmarker} what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero {disfmarker} set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a {disfmarker} a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in {disfmarker} So in this case you have some artificially imposed {pause} reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did {disfmarker} ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the {disfmarker} the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some {disfmarker} some , uh , very low or {disfmarker} or near zero {pause} value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that {disfmarker} that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: or pre - echoes , whichever they are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .\nGrad E: Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor B: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to {pause} keep in an echo than to throw out speech .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nPhD G: Um , what is the reverberation time {pause} like {pause} there ?\nGrad E: In thi in this room ? Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G: On , uh , the {disfmarker} the one what {disfmarker} the s in the speech that you are {disfmarker} you are using like ?\nGrad E: Y Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProfessor B: So , it 's this room .\nPhD G: It 's , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: It 's {disfmarker} it 's this room .\nPhD G: Oh , this room ?\nProfessor B: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: so it 's {disfmarker} these are just microphone {disfmarker} this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .\nGrad F: Oh .\nProfessor B: Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's {disfmarker} I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T\nGrad F: Hmm !\nProfessor B: something like that ? But it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's this room .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD G: OK . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in {disfmarker} w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a {disfmarker} he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has {pause} averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be {disfmarker} you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low {pause} energy compo portion , you might actually hear some {pause} funny things .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nGrad E: O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is {pause} just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I don't see why {disfmarker} why your signal is louder after processing , because yo\nGrad E: Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have {pause} better signal - to - noise ratio .\nPhD C: Well , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But just it being bigger if {disfmarker} with the same signal - to - noise ratio {disfmarker}\nGrad E: It w i i it wouldn't affect things .\nProfessor B: No .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: OK .\nPhD C: Well , the system is {disfmarker} use {pause} the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on {disfmarker} on the {pause} signal level . But , not so much , I guess .\nProfessor B: Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor B: So if the {disfmarker} if the {disfmarker} if you change {vocalsound} in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD A: Did you add {pause} this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ?\nGrad E: Uh {disfmarker} Um . Did I w what ?\nPhD A: Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect .\nGrad E: Sorry ? Yeah .\nPhD A: But I {disfmarker} I was {pause} sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I b\nPhD A: You didn't {pause} train it also .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I {disfmarker} I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I didn't {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .\nProfessor B: Oh , I see .\nGrad E: I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .\nProfessor B: OK . Well , I don't understand then . Yeah .\nGrad E: Huh . I don't know . If it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} like , if it 's trying to find a {disfmarker} a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out {disfmarker} that taking it out makes things louder . I mean .\nProfessor B: Uh , no . I mean , {vocalsound} uh , there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing inherent about removing {disfmarker} if you 're really removing ,\nGrad E: Nuh - huh .\nProfessor B: uh , r uh , then I don't {pause} see how that would make it louder .\nGrad E: The mean . OK . Yeah , I see .\nProfessor B: So it might be just some {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .\nProfessor B: Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that {disfmarker} that , uh , if you 're {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . I don't know .\nGrad E: Oh . OK .\nPhD A: I wonder if there could be something like , uh {disfmarker} for s for the PZM data ,\nPhD C: Eh\nPhD A: uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um {disfmarker} you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it {disfmarker} it could cause {pause} you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i maybe {disfmarker} i If , um {disfmarker} Subtracting the {disfmarker} the mean log spectrum is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your {disfmarker} if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a {disfmarker} a question of {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about .\nGrad E: Hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't know .\nPhD C: I had a question about the system {disfmarker} the SRI system . So , {vocalsound} you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on {pause} Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . Uh , but is it {pause} exactly the same system ?\nGrad E: Uh . I think so .\nPhD C: Hmm .\nGrad E: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a {disfmarker} a result on testing on Macrophone or {disfmarker} or training ?\nPhD C: all that stuff .\nGrad E: That 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: It was {pause} training on Macrophone and testing {disfmarker} yeah , on {disfmarker} on meeting digits .\nProfessor B: Oh . So that was done already . So we were {disfmarker} Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I 've just been text {comment} testing the new {pause} Aurora front - end with {disfmarker} well , Aurora system actually {disfmarker} so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have {disfmarker} I have two point seven percent error rate . And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine . So .\nProfessor B: Oh , that 's a lot better .\nPhD C: We are getting better .\nProfessor B: So , what {disfmarker} w ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker}\nPhD G: With the {disfmarker} with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?\nPhD C: Yeah . Two point seven .\nPhD G: I know in the meeting , like {disfmarker}\nPhD C: On the meeting we have two point seven .\nPhD G: Right . Oh .\nGrad F: That 's with the new IIR filters ?\nPhD C: Uh . Yeah , yeah . So , yeah ,\nGrad F: OK .\nPhD C: we have {pause} the new LDA filters , and {disfmarker} I think , maybe {disfmarker} I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . Uh , eh {disfmarker} Do y did you have a look at {disfmarker} at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I didn't . No .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: Hmm .\nPhD G: No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are {pause} recording it through a mike . I mean , any {disfmarker} all of the mikes have the DC removal {disfmarker} some capacitor sitting right in {pause} that bias it .\nProfessor B: Yeah . But this {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: And {disfmarker} and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics .\nPhD G: Oh , so it is the digital {disfmarker} OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .\nProfessor B: Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .\nPhD G: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: typi you know , unless {disfmarker} Actually , there are {pause} instrumentation mikes that {disfmarker} that do pass {disfmarker} go down to DC . But {disfmarker} but ,\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: uh , no , it 's the electronics . And they {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get , I think it was {disfmarker} I think it was in the {pause} Wall Street Journal data that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . There was this big DC - DC offset\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't know about for a while , while we were {pause} messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then we were talking to somebody and they said , \" Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? Everybody knows that . There 's all this DC offset in th \" So , yes . You can have DC offset in the data .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD G: OK .\nPhD A: So was that {disfmarker} was that everything , Dave ?\nGrad E: Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments {pause} about normalizing the phase . Um . So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . And , um , the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . They {disfmarker} they add in this modulo two pi way and , um , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really {pause} mathematically correct . So , {vocalsound} what I did instead is I {vocalsound} took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase {pause} off to normalize . But that , um , didn't work either .\nProfessor B: See , we have a different interpretation of this . He says it doesn't work . I said , I think it works magnificently , but just not for the task we intended . Uh , it gets rid of the speech .\nPhD A: What does it leave ?\nGrad F: Uh , gets rid of the speech .\nProfessor B: Uh , it leaves {disfmarker} you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's tremendous .\nGrad F: Oh , wow .\nProfessor B: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something .\nPhD A: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ?\nProfessor B: Ex - exactly . Yeah , you got it .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a general rule .\nPhD G: Oh , it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . Including what I just said .\nGrad E: And , yeah , that 's everything .\nPhD A: All set ? Do you want to go , Stephane ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because {pause} this is also one big difference between {pause} the two systems . Um , the other differences were {pause} the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more {disfmarker} SRI system are more complex . But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and\nPhD A: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system .\nPhD C: it was hard t to {disfmarker} to have some exper some improvement with this . Um .\nProfessor B: Well , it sounds like they also have {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right .\nPhD A: Well , there 's also the normalization .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD A: Like they do , um {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits ,\nPhD C: The vocal tr\nPhD A: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um {disfmarker} conversation - side normalization for the {pause} non - C - zero components ,\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like on {disfmarker} on the utterance levels .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But we have to do it {disfmarker} We have a system that does it on - line .\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: So , it might be {disfmarker} it might be better with {disfmarker} it might be worse if the {pause} channel is constant ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: or {disfmarker} Nnn .\nPhD G: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or {disfmarker} or is it the whole word ?\nPhD C: SRI {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's tr\nGrad F: SRI .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . I guess it 's triphones .\nPhD G: It 's triphone .\nProfessor B: I think it 's probably more than that .\nPhD C: Huh .\nProfessor B: I mean , so they {disfmarker} they have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things . So there 's {disfmarker} there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models and {disfmarker} and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .\nPhD G: Oh . It 's like the tied state .\nProfessor B: So .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: They have tied states and I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think {disfmarker} I think they {disfmarker} they don't just have triphones .\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor B: I think they have a range of {disfmarker} of , uh , dependencies .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Yeah . Well . Um . Well , the first thing I {disfmarker} that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . Uh . And maybe see with {pause} Andreas if {disfmarker} Well , I {disfmarker} I don't know {pause} how much it helps , what 's the model .\nPhD A: So {disfmarker} so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ?\nPhD C: That 's right . So it 's the clean {pause} TI - digits training set .\nPhD A: So exact same training data ?\nPhD C: Right .\nPhD A: OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . I guess you used the clean training set .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: For {disfmarker} with the SRI system {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Well .\nGrad E: You know , the {disfmarker} the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . But I don't think there 's any other difference .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B: So is that {disfmarker} ? Uh , are {disfmarker} are these results comparable ? So you {disfmarker} you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent {pause} on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits {disfmarker} {comment} TI - digits . Right ? And {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Um . Uh - huh .\nProfessor B: Yeah . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?\nPhD C: Yeah . I think so .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So it 's {pause} about the same ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: maybe a little worse .\nGrad E: W w it was one {disfmarker} one point two\nPhD C: Ye\nGrad E: with the SRI system ,\nProfessor B: I 'm sorry .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: I {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The complete SRI system is one point two .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you were HTK .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right ? OK . That 's right . So {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , so {pause} the comparable number then , uh {pause} for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the {pause} um , two point f\nPhD C: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , uh , b\nGrad E: D d\nProfessor B: Oh , right , right , right , right .\nPhD C: MFCC features {disfmarker}\nGrad E: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent .\nProfessor B: Right . Right , right , right .\nPhD C: Oh .\nProfessor B: OK . Alright . So {disfmarker} He 's doing some {pause} different things .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker} Yeah . The only difference is the features , right now , between this and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Yes . OK , good . So they are helping .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: That 's good to hear . Yeah .\nPhD C: They are helping . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And another thing I {disfmarker} I maybe would like to do is to {pause} just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone {disfmarker} test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: cuz I 'm still wondering {pause} where this {pause} improvement comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe {pause} Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than {disfmarker} than TI - digit is , which is {disfmarker} TI - digits are very {pause} clean recorded digits\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nPhD A: You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh {disfmarker} to do the regular Aurora test ,\nPhD C: Uh , f s\nPhD A: um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK .\nPhD C: That 's {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's what {pause} I wanted , just , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So , just using the SRI system , test it on {disfmarker} and test it on {pause} Aurora TI - digits . Right .\nPhD A: Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ?\nPhD C: Um . Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: So we don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: You 'd have to train the SRI system with {disfmarker} with all the different languages .\nPhD C: i i\nPhD A: Right .\nPhD C: We would have to train on {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Yeah . That 's what I mean .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: So , like , comple\nProfessor B: It 'd be a {pause} lot of work . That 's the only thing .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD A: Mmm .\nPhD C: It 's {disfmarker}\nPhD A: Well , I mean ,\nPhD C: Mmm .\nPhD A: uh , uh , I guess the work would be into getting the {disfmarker} the files in the right formats , or something . Right ? I mean {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh {disfmarker} you 're also training on all the data .\nPhD C: That 's right .\nPhD A: I mean , it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah . Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean .\nProfessor B: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: because {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good idea , but it seems like {pause} it makes sense to do some pruning\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: first with a {disfmarker} a test or two that makes sense for you ,\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and then {pause} take the likely candidates and go further .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information {pause} about what 's going on . And {disfmarker} mm - hmm . Uh , yeah . OK . Uh , the next thing is this {disfmarker} this VAD problem that , um , um {disfmarker} So , I 'm just talking about the {disfmarker} the curves that I {disfmarker} I sent {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I sent you {disfmarker} so , whi that shows that {vocalsound} when the SNR decrease , {vocalsound} uh , the current {pause} VAD approach doesn't drop much frames {pause} for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically .\nProfessor B: I i Just to clarify something for me . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So does any of this matter ? I mean , other than our interest in it . Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Uh {disfmarker} Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh {disfmarker} like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or {disfmarker} before and after speech . Uh . So removing more than that might still make {pause} a difference {pause} in the results .\nProfessor B: Do we {disfmarker} ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} No . Because we don't {disfmarker} didn't looked {pause} that much at that .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: But , {vocalsound} still , I think it 's an interesting problem .\nProfessor B: Oh , yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Um . Yeah .\nProfessor B: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when {disfmarker} when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . Because {pause} there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: And then the thing is if {disfmarker} if they really are going to have some means of giving us {pause} fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Um But {vocalsound} I don't know .\nPhD G: Because w we were wondering whether that {pause} VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if {disfmarker} if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: to find a {disfmarker} I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more {pause} suitable for us .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't {pause} use that information anymore ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .\nProfessor B: Right .\nPhD G: So . We don't know what is the type of {pause} {vocalsound} {pause} VAD which they 're going to provide .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . And actually there 's {disfmarker} Yeah . There 's an {disfmarker} uh , I think it 's still for {disfmarker} even for the evaluation , uh , it might still be interesting to {vocalsound} work on this because {pause} the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , {vocalsound} um , starting of speech and end of speech {pause} uh , at the utterance level . And {disfmarker} Um .\nPhD G: With some {disfmarker} some gap .\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that {disfmarker} whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .\nPhD C: Yeah . But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah . Then the they will just fill {disfmarker} fill it up .\nPhD C: it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , th {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: So if you could get at some of that , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: although that 'd be hard .\nPhD C: Yeah . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other {pause} things that we want to work on .\nProfessor B: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Right . OK .\nPhD C: But {disfmarker} Mmm . Yeah . So I did {disfmarker} I just {pause} started to test {pause} putting together two VAD which was {disfmarker} was not much work actually . Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , {vocalsound} um , energy - based VAD {vocalsound} that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . Um . So , which is just putting a threshold on {pause} the noise energy ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: and , detect detecting the first {pause} group of four frames {pause} that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . So it removes {vocalsound} the first silent portion {disfmarker} portion of each utterance . And it really removes it , um , still o on the noises where {pause} our MLP VAD doesn't {pause} work a lot .\nProfessor B: Mmm .\nPhD C: Uh ,\nProfessor B: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral {pause} information ,\nPhD C: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: uh {disfmarker} uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance {disfmarker} uh , would give you some {pause} better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or {disfmarker} or , uh {pause} stop consonants , or something like that .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Uh .\nPhD C: Yeah . So , your point is {disfmarker} will be to u use whatever {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and {pause} nonspeech . And , um ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And {disfmarker} and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a {disfmarker} a high - pass kind of characteristic {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: an upward slope . So having some kind of a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: uh , you know , at the beginning of a {disfmarker} of a {disfmarker} of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas , {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor B: it plus energy plus timing information is sort of {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of {pause} what they were using then .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD C: So , yeah . It {disfmarker} it might be that what I did is {disfmarker} so , removes like {vocalsound} low , um , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because {pause} the way I do it is I just {disfmarker} I just combine the two decisions {disfmarker} so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} with the and {pause} operator . So , I only {pause} keep the frames where the two agree {pause} that it 's speech . So if the energy - based dropped {disfmarker} dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are lost . Mmm .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: But s still , the way it 's done right now it {disfmarker} it helps on {disfmarker} on the noises where {disfmarker} it seems to help on the noises where {vocalsound} our VAD was not very {pause} good .\nProfessor B: Well , I guess {disfmarker} I mean , one could imagine combining them in different ways . But {disfmarker} but , I guess what you 're saying is that the {disfmarker} the MLP - based one has the spectral information . So .\nPhD C: Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done {disfmarker} Well , yeah .\nProfessor B: Well , you can imagine {disfmarker}\nPhD C: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is {disfmarker} So , it {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: Is {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are {disfmarker} are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them .\nProfessor B: Right . Right . And that might not be optimal ,\nPhD C: But , yeah .\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: No\nProfessor B: but {disfmarker} I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a probability estimated by each one and {disfmarker} and put them together .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah .\nPhD A: Something that {disfmarker} that I 've used in the past is , um {disfmarker} when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . And you {pause} make your decision when the derivative is increasing for {pause} so many frames . Then you say that 's beginning of speech .\nPhD C: Uh - huh .\nPhD A: But , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . I guess it depends on how you do it . But {pause} I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's been a useful thing .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,\nPhD A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: then only make a decision because {pause} you still need to smooth the {pause} decision further .\nPhD A: Right . Right .\nPhD G: So that 's always there .\nPhD A: Yeah . OK .\nPhD C: Well , actually if I don't {disfmarker} maybe don't want to work too much of {disfmarker} on it right now . I just wanted to {disfmarker} to see if it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I observed was the re was caused by this {disfmarker} this VAD problem .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And it seems to be the case . Um . Uh , the second thing is the {disfmarker} this spectral subtraction . Um . Um , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , {nonvocalsound} twenty - five experiments , uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use {pause} an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} noise than the noise spectra that {pause} is estimated {pause} on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . And after subtraction , I also add {pause} a constant noise , and I also try different , uh , {vocalsound} noise , uh , values and we 'll see what happen .\nProfessor B: Hmm . OK .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But st still when we look at the , um {disfmarker} Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . Um . On the other hand , when you {pause} subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but {pause} maybe you distort a lot of speech . So . Well . Mmm . Well , it {disfmarker} until now , it doesn't seem to help . But We 'll see . So the next thing , maybe I {disfmarker} what I will {pause} try to {disfmarker} to do is just {pause} to try to smooth mmm , {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .\nPhD C: Yeah . Right . Mmm .\nPhD G: Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?\nPhD C: Yeah . So , to get something that 's {disfmarker} would be closer to {pause} what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD G: Actually , it 's , uh {disfmarker} Uh . I don't know , it 's {disfmarker} go ahead .\nPhD C: It {disfmarker}\nPhD G: And it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Maybe you can {disfmarker}\nPhD G: go ahead .\nPhD C: I think it 's {disfmarker} That 's it for me .\nPhD G: OK . So , uh {disfmarker} u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are {disfmarker} there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was {disfmarker} I was assuming that always the VAD {disfmarker} uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances . So the {disfmarker} it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD C: So , in some cases s there are also {disfmarker}\nPhD G: SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .\nPhD C: o Uh - huh .\nPhD G: So that was one of the {pause} bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with {pause} different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the {disfmarker} the trend seems to be like , {vocalsound} uh , smoothing the {pause} current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like {pause} deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the {disfmarker} estimating the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like {disfmarker} it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like {pause} Smoothing the clean speech is {disfmarker} is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying {disfmarker} trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that {disfmarker} if some {disfmarker} In some cases the clean speech is , like {disfmarker} when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't {pause} vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like {disfmarker} So far I 've been testing only with the {pause} baseline , which is {disfmarker} which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the {disfmarker} the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral {disfmarker} I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was {disfmarker} but I just {vocalsound} took of those , uh , {pause} {vocalsound} Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a {disfmarker} a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's {disfmarker} it seems to be like it 's not {vocalsound} hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a {pause} four hertz {disfmarker} a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} just to see whether it really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can {disfmarker} that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how {disfmarker} how he derived those filters and {disfmarker} and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which {disfmarker} what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker}\nProfessor B: This is cubic root of power spectra ?\nPhD G: Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .\nProfessor B: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?\nPhD G: Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: So it has , like {disfmarker} the spectrogram has , like {disfmarker} Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's {disfmarker} there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So , those are the regions where there are , like {disfmarker} when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: So . That 's {pause} something I observe using that filter . And {disfmarker} Yeah . There are a few {disfmarker} very {disfmarker} not a lot of {disfmarker} because the filter doesn't have a {disfmarker} really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and {disfmarker} but while {pause} making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's it , Morgan .\nProfessor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace {pause} stuff ?\nPhD G: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about {pause} finding those bugs and\nProfessor B: OK .\nPhD G: th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that .\nPhD A: How about you , Carmen ?\nPhD D: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy .\nProfessor B: Hmm ?\nPhD D: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to {disfmarker} to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then {vocalsound} we decided that that 's {disfmarker} it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And {disfmarker} Well , thinking about that , we {disfmarker} we then {disfmarker} we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} I didn't {pause} do the experiment yet {disfmarker} to apply VTS in cepstral domain .\nProfessor B: The other thing {pause} is {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so , in {disfmarker} i i and {disfmarker} Not {disfmarker} and C - zero would be a different {disfmarker} So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have {pause} two kinds of normalization with {disfmarker} with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization {vocalsound} s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I don't know . But {disfmarker} but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,\nPhD D: Uh .\nProfessor B: so that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Well , we s decide to m to {disfmarker} to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And {disfmarker} Well . I am working in that now ,\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: but {vocalsound} I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot {disfmarker} It 's a lot of work .\nProfessor B: Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Well , it 's not too much , but this {disfmarker} it 's work .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: And I want to know if {disfmarker} if we have some {pause} feeling that {pause} the result {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to know if {disfmarker} I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel {disfmarker} in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I don't {disfmarker} I don't know absolutely nothing .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well , you 're {disfmarker} I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh ,\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: I don't {disfmarker} I don't have a good feeling for it . Um .\nPhD G: Pratibha .\nPhD C: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so {pause} the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the {pause} level of the speech signal .\nPhD D: Yeah ?\nPhD C: And {disfmarker} So I expect it {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to , uh , be a better model of speech .\nPhD D: To have better {disfmarker}\nPhD C: And . Well .\nProfessor B: You {disfmarker} you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the {disfmarker}\nPhD C: No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . And then you have {pause} one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: and the other which isn't .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean {pause} of speech and not of noise .\nPhD D: Ye\nPhD C: Because it 's like {pause} first doing general normalization\nPhD D: Yea\nPhD C: and then noise removal , which is {disfmarker}\nPhD D: Yeah . We {disfmarker} I was thinking to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to estimate the noise {pause} with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: before the on - line normalization .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: We {disfmarker} we see {disfmarker} Well , I am thinking {vocalsound} about that and working about that ,\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nPhD D: but I don't have result this week .\nProfessor B: Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about {disfmarker} maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because {pause} we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their {pause} characteristics are ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: so we can see what should be combined .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Is that it ? OK ?\nProfessor B: OK . Why don't we read some digits ?\nPhD A: Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?\nProfessor B: Sure .\nPhD A: Transcript L dash two one five .\nProfessor B: O K .",

            "context": "Project Manager: So\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing: Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager: So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , um\nUser Interface: Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing: yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing: So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: F_ F_ five .\nMarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager: F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Agree .\nMarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager: Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing: Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface: No , I don't think so .\nMarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing: So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nUser Interface: Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface: Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: So anyway\nUser Interface: One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface: Functions .\nMarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nMarketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface: I got one question ,\nMarketing: I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nMarketing: Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing: yeah ?\nUser Interface: so\nMarketing: I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing: I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: That's good point .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , yep .\nUser Interface: Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: 'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing: So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's\nMarketing: No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager: what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Argh .\nIndustrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager: So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager: Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface: So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing: Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface: Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer: li\nProject Manager: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing: Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface: Findings .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh sorry .\nUser Interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: It's off .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: It's on .\nUser Interface: the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing: And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing: Oh so you have a\nUser Interface: like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing: sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It's easy to do ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer: Distance .\nUser Interface: According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: which change colours ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: So basically that's it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface: Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . S\nUser Interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager: Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface: Uh twenty five .\nMarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing: Or is it ?\nUser Interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing: Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing: I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing: Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: and then it go\nMarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer: t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah\nUser Interface: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing: so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah. .\nUser Interface: Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing: So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager: uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager: You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager: On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface: Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager: It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing: Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so we can make really simp\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing: Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing: Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer: then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing: Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager: No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing: It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing: Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface: Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing: T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface: or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer: because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing: no ?\nIndustrial Designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nMarketing: And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing: So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer: They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager: No .\nIndustrial Designer: like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer: Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: mm\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing: Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer: Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing: Difficult .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager: Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah\nUser Interface: control ,\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It just beeps .\nUser Interface: Just beeps ?\nMarketing: That would be enough .\nProject Manager: Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing: Something very cheap .\nProject Manager: Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing: But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager: yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing: You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager: Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Clap is good .\nProject Manager: I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Tak\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: okay okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface: Oops .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think about it .\nProject Manager: yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Good\nProject Manager: So ,\nMarketing: we're done ?\nProject Manager: yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing: Right , thanks .\nProject Manager: {gap}",

            "input": "What was the discussion about the government's policy to improve long-term care facilities and protect the seniors?",
            "context": "The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Anandasangaree.\nMr. Gary Anandasangaree (ScarboroughRouge Park, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I speak today with a very heavy heart. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes. I'm thankful for the Canadian Armed Forces who were deployed to the Altamont care home in my riding and four other facilities across the GTA. The CAF have brought forward horrifying allegations in the operation of these homes. They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time; being forcibly fed, causing choking; being bed-bound for weeks; receiving inadequate nutrition, and much more. Mr. Chair, I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations. I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario. Finally, Mr. Chair, we need to work with the provinces and territories to set national standards of care for the most vulnerable in our society. We can and must do better. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nThe Chair: We have a point of order. Go ahead, Ms. May.\nMs. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hesitate to interrupt colleagues, but I'm concerned about the petition practice, which, as I understand it, is to summarize a petition but not make a speech. I felt one of our colleagues was trespassing on our usual rules.\nThe Chair: I will remind honourable members that when a petition is presented, we're expected to give a prcis and make it as concise as possible. Thank you. Mr.Champoux, you have the floor.\nMr. Martin Champoux (Drummond, BQ): Mr.Chair, I would like to recognize the resilience of Quebeckers concerned for their jobs or their businesses during the COVID-19 crisis. They need us to plan for after the crisis, and we must do so now. To do so, we need the proper information. We need to know the status of the public finances. That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June17. This is not about making a spectacle. Everyone knows that the deficit will be huge. We had to provide the people with support and we all agree on that. But we have to know to what extent. We also have to know where we are starting from so that we can plan where we are going. This is about respecting the public, because they are the ones who will be paying the bill. In closing, I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada. The Liberals promised to correct this injustice. Now is a great time for them to do so.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Sidhu.\nMs. Sonia Sidhu (Brampton South, Lib.): Mr. Chair, this week is National Paramedic Services Week. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police, paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe. In my riding, organizations have stepped up to help our community. Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society, the Interfaith Council of Peel, the Brampton YMCA, the Prayer Stone Peoples Church, Unity in the Community, Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, Knights Table, the Yogi Divine Society, Vraj Community Service, Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time. I also have to address the report that came out yesterday from our brave Canadian Armed Forces. Like many Canadians, I was shocked by this report from the long-term care centres, including one in my riding. The examples of abuse described in the report are unacceptable. Our seniors deserve dignity and respect. We must find a solution. We need to fix this.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Mrs. Stubbs.\nMrs. Shannon Stubbs (Lakeland, CPC): Mr. Chair, Canada's oil and gas sector is in crisis, made worse by five years of bad policies, red tape and barriers to pipelines. Just in the last two months, we saw the largest production cut in Canadian history. Active rigs dropped by 92% and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs, adding to the 200,000 since 2015. Energy is Canada's biggest investor, and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions, not just words. On March 25, the finance minister promised help in hours or days, not weeks, but he's letting Canadians down. Sixty-three days later, small oil and gas companies still can't apply for BDC loans, and last week's large employer loan terms are predatory, with interest rates escalating to 14% by year five. Those are payday loan rates. The required stock options being at record lows could make the government the largest shareholder. That's not emergency assistance; it's pandemic profiteering. Programs can't help workers if businesses can't or won't actually get the support. The Liberals' death-by-delay tactics are doing exactly what foreign activists in other countries want: to shut down Canada's oil.\nThe Chair: Ms.Bessette, the floor is yours.\nMrs. Lyne Bessette (BromeMissisquoi, Lib.): Mr.Chair, in times of crisis, we stick together. I can state that this is certainly the case in BromeMissisquoi. In the last weeks, I have been calling volunteer action centres in my constituency so that they can tell me their news. I would like to take the time that I have to highlight the work that community organizations are doing tirelessly in my constituency. The crisis has made us realize the extent to which food banks and meals-on-wheels can not only relieve hunger, but also relieve thousands of shut-in seniors of their loneliness. Let me also highlight the devotion of the volunteers giving generously of their time, particularly the initiative of Mabel Hastings in the volunteer aid centre in Mansonville. Like me, she sends out a daily newsletter to keep the public informed about the many resources available for their support. COVID-19 is bringing out the best in our community and I am certain that, together, we will get through it.\nThe Chair: We will go to Mr. Virani.\nMr. Arif Virani (ParkdaleHigh Park, Lib.): Mr. Chair, during the COVID-19 pandemic I have been inspired by the courageous work of so many essential workers. I want to thank everyone on the front lines for keeping us safe, keeping us fed and keeping our communities functioning. I want to make special note of one particular essential health care worker, a woman who is a quarantine manager with the Public Health Agency of Canada. I have personally seen her working tirelessly over the past three months to keep all of us safe. That woman is my wife, Suchita Jain. Suchi, I love you, I am very proud of you and I thank you for all of the sacrifices you are making. I want to highlight another woman from my riding of ParkdaleHigh Park, Rachelle LeBlanc. She is a local designer. When the pandemic broke, she saw the need for protective barriers for small shops in Parkdale, so she set about collecting donations. She then put her design talents to work and started designing free-standing protective shields. Rachelle's team has now delivered 25 free COVID protective shields to small shopkeepers in Parkdale, and the team is on track to building 100 more. It's the compassion of Canadians like Rachelle that gives meaning to the phrase we are all in this together.\nThe Chair: Mr.Godin, you have the floor.\nMr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC): Mr.Chair, the school year has been shattered and our graduating classes must be proud of what they have achieved amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Young men, young women, be proud of your accomplishments! You can believe in the future. Keep learning. It will give you tools that will serve you all your lives. What you have achieved in this extraordinary year will set you apart from the others. I invite you to be inspired by that and turn it to your advantage. The current government has the obligation to promote the values that will lead you to become involved in your communities. Your willingness to learn or to work makes you into better citizens. Knowledge and experience are irreplaceable and invaluable. I implore this government, which is unaware of the damage it is causing, to immediately announce all the positions that have already been approved under the Canada summer jobs program. Urgent action is needed. Let us have confidence in our organizations, our companies, and let us support our youth, a rich resource that we must equip and motivate. I congratulate all the young graduates in the beautiful constituency of PortneufJacques-Cartier.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Mr. Fergus.\nMr. Greg Fergus (HullAylmer, Lib.): Mr.Chair, this pandemic lets us see what Canadians are made of. This coming Saturday, May30, more than 2,000Christians of all denominations are coming together virtually for prayer and for action. When the going gets tough, Canadians get going. This could not be more true than with respect to what will be happening on May 30. This Saturday, in more than 2,000 churches and homes, thousands of faith-filled Canadians are gathering to pray and act on those prayers as part of Stand United Canada. They will gather through television, Facebook Live and Instagram Live. Then they are going to deliver much-needed support to at-risk Canadians who live in disadvantaged areas. This is faith in action. I'm sure I speak for all parliamentarians when I wish success to Stand United Canada. I hope it inspires more Canadians to follow in its footsteps. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Ms. Harder.\nMs. Rachael Harder (Lethbridge, CPC): The best way to safeguard the truth is to allow people to speak freely, but from the very beginning of this pandemic, the Liberals have silenced dissent. Sadly, their short-sightedness has been to the detriment of Canadians. Early on, they propagated the notion that human-to-human transmission wasn't possible. They said that closing the borders wasn't necessary. They told us that wearing face masks wouldn't help. It is undeniable that the Liberal government has put Canadians in danger by silencing alternative points of view and has spread misinformation. Ironically, however, they have now gone ahead and crowned themselves the arbiters of truth. They are spending millions of dollars to censor what Canadians can and cannot say. They are determining what is true and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, what is in and what is out. When freedom of speech is repressed, it is safe to say that democracy is under siege. I call upon the government to restore the personal liberties that are granted under our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is Canada. We are not an autocracy; we are a democracy.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Mr. Nater.\nMr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC): Mr. Chair, small businesses have always been the cornerstone of communities across this country. They provide employment and economic stability and are always the first to support community functions and activities, but small businesses have been particularly hard hit due to COVID-19. They have shut their doors temporarily, and now many worry they'll never be able to open their doors again. With the season cancellations at the Stratford Festival, Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music, businesses in the tourism, hospitality, accommodation and retail sectors in PerthWellington are struggling. Every day, I talk to small business owners who can't access the Canada emergency business account, and others who find the convoluted commercial rent assistance program to be out of reach. The program is needlessly complicated, frustratingly slow and excessively restrictive. Mr. Chair, the government needs to go back, fix these programs and ensure that support goes to the small businesses that need it.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Ms. Collins.\nMs. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP): Mr. Chair, Canadians have been shaken by this pandemic. It has exposed the gaps in our health care system and our social safety net. It has shown how vulnerable we all are when disaster hits. It has brought us to a crossroads. We can go backwards to so-called business as usual, with horrific conditions in long-term care homes, widespread inequality and no real action on climate change, or we can build for better. In Victoria, people in the community, organizations and municipal leaders have been calling for a new way forward. The City of Victoria has a plan for reinvention, resilience and recovery. Organizations like Greater Victoria Acting Together; Common Vision, Common Action; and Kairos Victoria are exploring ideas for a sustainable and just recovery. We can build for better. We can invest in the infrastructure. We need to fight climate change, homelessness and inequality. We can build a Canada where we take better care of the planet and each other.\nThe Chair: We now move to Ms.DeBellefeuille.\nMrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ): Mr.Chair, in this time of pandemic, it is with heartfelt emotion that I want to highlight the excellent work of all the guardian angels at the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the entire staff, as well as the retirees who have come back to provide their assistance. I admire the managers, at all levels and in all services, working tirelessly so that their teams can answer the call in this difficult situation. My fellow managers and the management teams of the Support Program for the Autonomy of Seniors, both in home support and in residential care, you have my heartfelt congratulations for the herculean work you have done. My thoughts go particularly to Lyne Ricard and Vronique Proulx, managers working diligently with their teams of professionals to support the seniors living in intermediate resources, as we call them. I also warmly recognize the director of nursing services, Chantal Careau, who is facing the current challenge with passion and humanity. Once again, my congratulations go to the entire organization of the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest for their remarkable work in this difficult and very demanding time.\nThe Chair: We will go to Mr. Barlow.\nMr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC): During the worst of times, we see the best in people. Heroes are born, characters revealed, resiliency is sowed. I cannot say enough about my constituents in Foothillsfront-line health care workers, grocery store clerks, restaurateurs, farmersfor all they are doing to keep our community safe and healthy. I want to shine a light on some of our hidden heroes, such as Owen Plumb, a grade 9 student in Okotoks who is using his 3D printer to build PPE for front-line health care workers. He partnered with the Rotary Club and Evergreen Solutions in Okotoks to help with the manufacturing and assembly. There is also Sam Schofield, the volunteer president of the Pincher Creek Chamber of Commerce, overnight built a resiliency website for COVID-19 by building training tools for businesses throughout his area. He also helped develop the Foothills Business Recovery Taskforce, which is a resource for businesses throughout southern Alberta in my riding. Finally, to the employees of Cargill Foods in High River, I know this has been a very difficult time and that many of you have lost loved ones. I want to say thank you for tirelessly doing all you can to protect our food supply and keep food on our table. Each and every one of you is a hero. Thank you.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Chair: We will now go to Mr. Simms.\nMr. Scott Simms (Coast of BaysCentralNotre Dame, Lib.): Thank you, Chair. I would like to take this time to salute those who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide care and comfort to others. In my 16 years in the House of Commons I have never experienced anything like this, when we find our lives are at a standstill and there is so much sorrow felt by families who suffer from the effects of COVID-19. However, here are two examples of kindness right here in Newfoundland and Labrador. Shanna and Fred Patey of Bishop's Falls, along with a few of their friends, spend hours next to the Trans-Canada Highway with just a barbeque and a cooler. They serve free meals for truckers crossing our province each and every day. So far they have provided over 1,500 meals. There is also Mitch Strickland of Grand Falls-Windsor, who owns Appy's Diner. He has continually provided food for the local hospital and other front-line workers through his donations. To all our front-line workers in grocery stores and delivery trucks, and to doctors, nurses, LPNs, paramedics, first responders and, of course, our brave women and men in the military, we will be forever grateful and blessed because of you. Thank you.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Chair: That's all the time we have today for Statements by Members. Before going on, I just want to remind all the members that it is a one-minute statement, so if you don't mind, please time it before coming in because we do have limited time. The other thing that has come up is that some of you just naturally speak very quickly. I'm not here to judge anybody's way of speaking, but try to consider the translators and interpreters to make sure that everyone understands what is said, because they are working diligently to try to get both languages out. In sum, there are two things: please slow down and please make sure the statement is confined to one minute. We now move to Questions to Ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow the employees who are providing support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely.  Our first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. In the early days of the pandemic and the lockdown that followed, Canadians were told by this government that programs would be rolled out very quickly and that gaps and shortcomings would be changed as time went on. While many Canadians are being let down by this government's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs, Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago, yet here we are, two and a half months later, and many of these programs still have not been improved. I have a simple question for the Prime Minister. On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs. It's now May 27. Is the Prime Minister going to make that change?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Mr. Chair, we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly, and that's what we did. We rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly. Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19. We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses. What we've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country, but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it's a little more difficult for them to qualify. We are working with them through their regional development agencies, and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs, which will be able to help them get the money they deserve.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government. There's no excuse for the delay. It's May 27. They've known about these problems for weeks. They're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March, and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes. For example, companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened. The businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together. We have identified this gap. Again, it's a simple question. Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, I know that there are many different types of businesses across this country that need support. We have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can, and we continue to work on filling gaps. I know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding. I can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there's a way to make sure we're getting them the support they need.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's actually a very simple fix. I can save him and his officials a lot of time. The government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program. He can make this very clear, and save a lot of work, just by including the word acquisition. Will he do that?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, I can assure you that finance officials are working closely with Brandt Tractor. They're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that, for various reasons, are not able to apply for the help we have now. We will continue to work to make sure people who need the help get it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it's literally one word. We can email him the text. We can send him the page in the dictionary where that word is defined, if that would help. Another gap that is letting people down is in the rent relief program. The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70% revenue loss. There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50%, 55%, 60% or 65% loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent. We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open. Will the government introduce some flexibility to this program to help more businesses survive?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, our public servants and policy-makers have been moving creatively and quickly to try to get help to as many people as we possibly can, with our focus being on the people who need it the most. Obviously, this pandemic is affecting everyone and every business across the country in different ways, but our focus has been on ensuring that those who most need it are getting the help they can. We will, of course, continue to work with the parties opposite and all Canadians to ensure that we're getting help to everyone who needs it, but our focus has always been on the most vulnerable, first and foremost.\nThe Chair: The floor now goes to Mr.Blanchet.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question is for the Prime Minister. If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs, would it have laid off all its staff?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19. People work for those organizations, as accountants, receptionists, assistants or labourers, and those people need to be supported. We are supporting people all over the country through that program.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is the Liberal Party one of those organizations in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Any company or organization that can demonstrate a significant drop in its income, whether that be in donations, receipts, profits\nThe Chair: The floor goes to Mr.Blanchet.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we created specific criteria to help organizations in difficulty. Any organization experiencing those difficulties can apply.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: In the Magdalen Islands, fishing companies in difficulty and in need of assistance will not have the money that the Liberals are going to take. Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have invested in assistance for fishers all across the country. We recognize that it is a difficult situation because of COVID-19. We will be here for our fishers and for industries in difficulty.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: I am not catching many answers, it seems to me. A company in Drummondville that manufactures isolation membranes is in difficulty because a federal program is inadequate. Compared to that company, is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, there are clear criteria for submitting applications under these programs. Companies and organizations that receive money qualify for those programs.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: If the program criteria establish that the Liberal Party is an organization in difficulty, does that mean that the criteria to determine whether an organization is in difficulty are poorly designed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, all through this pandemic, our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs. This applies to all organizations and companies in the country to the extent possible. That is what we are in the process of doing.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Given the answers from the Prime Minister, let me ask this question: is the Prime Minister in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: No, Mr.Chair. We are doing important work for all Canadians, every day.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Restaurant owners on rue Ontario in Montreal feel that they will not make it through the crisis and that they will never open their doors again. They are in difficulty. By comparison, is the Liberal Party of Canada an organization in difficulty that will not open its doors again after the crisis? We can but hope.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established criteria for that program in order to help those working for various organizations. Any organization that receives the subsidy has qualified for it.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is there a consensus in the Liberal Party caucus that the Liberal Party is in difficulty as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are working every day to help Canadians and workers in difficulty. We are going to continue to do that work.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Does answering a question put the Prime Minister in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, it is a pleasure to be here in the House and to answer questions from Canadians and from members of the opposition.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: You are going to answer a question from a Quebecker, I hope. Companies are struggling in Saguenay, in the Gasp, in Beloeil. Would those companies not deserve to be saved by the money that the supposedly struggling Liberal Party has taken?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: I am always very happy to answer questions from all Canadians currently sitting in the House. We will be here to help workers in difficulty all across the country, including in Quebec.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: If the Prime Minister is so happy to answer questions, I hope he will be delirious with joy to answer this one. Is the Liberal Party in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established a program to help those working in organizations and who could lose their jobs because of COVID-19. We are here to help workers in organizations and companies all over the country.\nThe Chair: We'll now go on to Mr. Singh.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling, but seniors need more than just compassionate words. They need action. Will the Prime Minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the Constitution of Canada is not an excuse. It lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities, and we respect the provinces' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities. However, from the very beginning, we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue. We need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for, which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: The former federal health minister, Dr. Philpott, said, We need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership. That is a former federal health minister. Now, we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost. Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in long-term care?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, over the past couple of days I've had very good conversations with the premiers of both Quebec and Ontario on this important issue. I look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well. This is something that Canadians have seen needs concerted action. We will be there to support the provinces.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Needles were reused and expired medication was used, according to military reports. Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in the care of our seniors?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the contents of that report were deeply disturbing and troubling for all Canadians. That is why we are committed to working with the provinces to fix this situation. Ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they've seen going on. We need to fix this, and we will do that together.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: The military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions. Going forward, we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: The military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, all Canadians know we need to do better by our seniors. This is something we all take very seriously, and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now, and going forward, we improve our systems. The federal government will be there to work with the provinces on making that happen.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister has said that he's willing to work with the provinces. I'm saying that we need to see federal leadership. We need a commitment at the federal level that the Prime Minister will push for things that people need, which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards. Will the Prime Minister go beyond working with provinces and show some leadership?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, I will always be here to stand up for Canadians in all different situations. We are going to work with the provinces, fully respecting jurisdictions, to make sure that, all across the country, Canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve.\nThe Chair: Mr. Singh, we have 30 seconds. Ask a brief question, please.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Thank you very much. The COVID-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee, in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice. This is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide, the same government that delayed the United Nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court. Will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas, including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence. We will continue to work with those partners, but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers, not on establishing the report. We will continue to work with them on the report, but the COVID-19 situation has made that more difficult.\nThe Chair: I want to thank the honourable members who are shouting time, but I do have a timer here, and I am taking care of it. I appreciate the help, but I do want to remind them that I have the proper machinery here. We will now go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan: Thank you, Chair. My question is to the Prime Minister. He was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario, and there was a report out from Quebec today. I want to commend the Canadian Armed Forces for witnessing these appalling conditions, putting it in the context of a report, and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities. The government is saying they didn't receive the report from the department until May 22, but this report came out on May 14. What happened to that report for eight days?\nThe Chair: We will go to the honourable minister. We seem to have a technical issue, Mr. Sajjan. We can't hear you. You might want to put down your bar and keep it down while you're speaking.\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence): Mr. Chair, I want to thank our Canadian Armed Forces members for the tremendous work they are doing. They did their duty, noted down their observations and reported them. While those observations were being reported directly to the managers, a report was being compiled. This report was given to me on the 21st. I then forwarded it to the Minister of Public Safety on the 22nd, and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards.\nMr. James Bezan: I trust that you got the report on the 21st, but the report was written on the 14th, so what happened with that report for seven days? Why wasn't it acted upon? Could you just explain that? Our loved ones were at risk during that entire time.\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, as we stated, this report was done and given up through the chain of command, and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence. Once we received this report, it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities. Again, I want to commend our Canadian Armed Forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty.\nMr. James Bezan: That report from Ontario documented appalling conditions, horrific care that was being given to the clients, and also the way that the staff conducted themselves. We know that there are 39 members of the Canadian Armed Forces currently infected with COVID-19. Minister, do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, when it comes to any type of activities that we send our Canadian Armed Forces on, we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training. This is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment. We have the right protocols in place, and we will make sure that our members who are infected by COVID will get the appropriate treatment as well.\nMr. James Bezan: Does the Minister of National Defence believe that our soldiers serving in Operation Laser, who have put themselves in harm's way in battling the COVID virus as a war, deserve to have hazard pay benefits?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, when it comes to looking after Canadian Armed Forces personnel, yes, we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay. This is currently being drafted, and we will have more to say on this shortly.\nMr. James Bezan: I hope that means it's a yes. I do encourage the government to provide that compensation to our soldiers and troops serving in Operation Laser. I would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from May 14 to May 21, when that report was in the department for one week. Under our parliamentary system, ministers are accountable for the conduct of their departments. Will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear: When it comes to the observations that were made, those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province. At the same time, this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command, and they did their due diligence. As I stated, it was given to us, and on the same day it was forwarded to the Minister of Public Safety, who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities.\nMr. James Bezan: Was one of those authorities that this was sent to the RCMP?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, as stated, this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC): Thank you, Chair. Yesterday it was revealed that the Minister of Digital Government has been promoting a fundraising campaign to sue Global News for their story criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Why is the minister using her authority to support the Communist Party of China and threatening our media and freedom of expression?\nHon. Joyce Murray (Minister of Digital Government): Mr. Chair, we value the important work of media right across the country. Attacking the integrity of hard-working journalists is simply not acceptable. Like many members on all sides of the House.... WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with\nThe Chair: Now we'll go back to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is the minister aware of the efforts that the United Front carries out on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to influence how Canadians view the People's Republic of China?\nHon. Joyce Murray: Thank you for that question. Mr. Chair, I want to just be clear. The participation in the WeChat group, much like Facebook, is guided by posted\nThe Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is the minister an active participant in the efforts by the Communists to muzzle a Canadian journalist and deprive Canadians of the facts about China?\nHon. Joyce Murray: Muzzling journalists is never acceptable, and our government is very clear on that. I will say that the individual in question posted something outside of the guidelines of my WeChat group and is no longer\nThe Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk, I just want to point out that we do have interpreters listening and trying to interpret. They'd appreciate it....\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: My questions are short. That's probably what it is.\nThe Chair: Take a deep breath.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, the Liberals can't shrug this off. The minister admitted to theBreaker that her own political staff manages this WeChat. This is someone who is paid by Canadian taxpayers. Why is the minister using tax dollars to help China attack Global News and freedom of expression?\nHon. Joyce Murray: I think the member knows very well that the people who post on WeChat are free to post what they choose within certain guidelines. Those guidelines were ignored. That person is no longer part of my WeChat group. The post was completely unacceptable, and I do not share the views of the individual.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, Sam Cooper is an investigative Canadian journalist who has uncovered many different criminal rackets that can be linked back to Beijing. Has the minister apologized to Sam Cooper for attempting to shut down his work?\nHon. Joyce Murray: As we all know, community outreach is a very important part of the work of a member of Parliament. WeChat is one of many social media sites regularly used by members\nThe Chair: We go back to Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, when will the minister apologize to Sam Cooper and Global News?\nHon. Joyce Murray: Mr. Chair, I have been very clear that I do not share the views of the person who posted on my WeChat site, who operated outside of my\nThe Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, in December 2018 the Liberals passed Bill C-76. This included provisions to prevent foreign interference in Canadian society. Does the government believe that Joyce Murray's actions have violated this portion of the act?\nHon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, I want to assure the member that we are always vigilant in any foreign interference in our national security or issues of political interference in our society. It's monitored carefully by the national security establishment, according to the law as it exists in this country, and we will remain vigilant.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, in May 2019, the Liberals launched their digital charter. One of the principles was strong democracy, a commitment to defend freedom of expression. Will the Liberals hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated this part of the charter?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, we are absolutely committed to the rule of law and will always uphold it. I think, as the minister has made very clear, she was not involved in this process and has no control over the individual who posted that matter.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, unfortunately I don't believe that was a sufficient answer. This is really a yes or no. Will the government hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated their part of the charter?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, Mr. Chair, I want to assure the member that our government remains committed to the rule of law and we will always work tirelessly to uphold the laws of this country.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is that a yes or a no?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, I think it was very clear. We will always uphold the laws of Canada.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Still, was that a yes or a no? I'm not hearing a yes or a no.\nHon. Bill Blair: I am doing my very best, Mr. Chair, to answer the question for the House and to assure the member opposite that our government will always remain committed to the rule of law. That is unequivocal.\nThe Chair: We will now move on to the honourable member. The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell.\nMr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am very happy and proud to be participating in this discussion in the House of Commons today. My question is very simple: how much is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr.Chair, we continue to be transparent with our measures. Of course, we want to make sure that our investments, our economy\nThe Chair: The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Let me ask my question to the honourable Minister of Finance once more, since he is talking about transparency. My question is really simple: how much is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, our economic situation is very fluid. We have made major investments and we are making sure that our economy is working.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, the minister's answer is not fluid at all. But the question is really simple: how much is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, it is important to be transparent with our investments. We look at the investments and the figures every day.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, the Minister of Finance may not know what the deficit is, but one great Canadian does know. And he knows that he knows. Could the Minister of Finance be very clear, very fluid and, above all, very transparent with Canadians? What is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I want to be very clear with Canadians: our economic situation is very difficult. The situation is fluid. We are making investments to ensure that our economy will be strong in the future.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, with all due respect to the Minister of Finance, let me point out that, though he is not very clear, Canada's Parliamentary Budget Officer was clear yesterday. The deficit is $260billion. That is the real number. Why does the government not have the courage to state it clearly, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer did yesterday?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we always want to be clear and transparent. It is very important for the situation to be stable in order to ensure our future. That is our economic approach. We are making investments now so that the situation becomes more stable.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, I know that the Minister of Finance is very good with figures. But he is not able to give us one. Perhaps he could comment on the statement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer made yesterday, that the emergency assistance must have an end date, and if it does not, we are heading to levels of taxation that have not been seen in this country for generations. What is the government going to do to make sure that Canadians will not be overtaxed after this crisis?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to make investments. That way, we will have a resilient economy in the future. That's very important. That way, we know that we'll have a good economy in the future. When we have more information, we will\nThe Chair: Mr.Deltell, you have the floor.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, will the minister commit not to raise taxes after the crisis?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I have said several times that we do not have a plan to raise taxes. That's very important.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Finally a clear answer! However, I'm not convinced that he will apply it. In fact, the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself has said that there isn't much ammunition left without shifting into a large structural deficit, which can lead directly to tax increases. If the Minister of Finance can't even say today what the deficit is today, how can he be credible when he says that he won't raise taxes?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I think what's most important is that during this pandemic, Canadians and companies across the country need the Government of Canada's help. That is our approach. That way, we will have an economy that will function in the future. Of course, this is important for future generations.\nMr. Grard Deltell: When will there be an economic update?\nHon. Bill Morneau: \nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, all observers are expecting an economic update to know where we're going. When will that happen?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we want our economic update to be accurate. That's why we are looking at information that allow us to make good forecasts.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC): Mr. Chair, the United States, Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam have created an economic prosperity group to diversify some of their key supply chains away from China. Canada has a free trade agreement with six of these seven countries. Why are we not part of this group?\nHon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade): Mr. Chair, I thank the hon. member for that question. Indeed, we have been working diligently with all of these countries to make sure that we are keeping global supply chains open during this critical time. I think everyone agrees that keeping supply chains open for medical goods, critical agriculture and essential goods is absolutely essential and\nThe Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, this government is refusing to come to terms with what COVID-19 will mean for the future of international trade. Why is Canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same?\nThe Chair: Before we go to the minister, one of the members has his mike still on, and I would ask that he turn it off. I am hearing background noise. The hon. minister.\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, Canada has unprecedented access to a number of markets around the world because of the extraordinary agreements that we have made to provide access to customers in those international markets. During COVID-19, we have been working with our G20 partners. I have had two meetings with G20 trade ministers on the importance of keeping supply chains\nThe Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, is this payback for the Prime Minister snubbing these countries at the original TPP signing?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we have a CPTPP arrangement with these countries, and we are looking forward to making sure that we get Canadian businesses growing into those markets.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the U.K. will begin applying tariffs at the beginning of next year on Canadian exports such as seafood, beef and cars. These are the items that have had tariffs removed under CETA. Will the government commit to having a new trade agreement with the U.K. in place by January 1?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we are monitoring the situation very carefully. The U.K., of course, is a very important trading partner for Canada. They are in discussions right now. I want to assure Canadian businesses that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the U.K. during this period while they go through Brexit.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, after CUSMA, this government guaranteed to the trade committee that they would publish the objectives of any new trade agreement. When will we see these objectives published and actually have a chance to view them?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we look forward to working to ensure that those objectives are published as we get into future trade discussions.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the resignation of the WTO director-general at this unprecedented time is concerning for the international trade community. Is the government committed to supporting a DG candidate who is dedicated to the massive reforms needed to get the WTO functioning again?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the hon. member for that good question. The Ottawa group, led by Canada, is working with like-minded countries on the reform of the WTO. We've been doing this work and we continue to do this work. I look forward to making sure that we are leading the way on those discussions with like-minded\nThe Chair: Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, last week the President of the United States considered blocking cattle imports. Our beef producers don't need this. They need stability. Three-quarters of Canada's beef cattle exports go to the U.S. Has the government sought out and received assurances from the United States that no such action will apply to Canadian cattle?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs): Mr. Chair, we have an excellent assurance of our trade with the United States, which is our new NAFTA trade agreement that we have negotiated, thanks to the unprecedented co-operation across this country. It is very important to the Canadian economy and Canadian producers.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, going forward post-COVID, there are a lot things that will be changing in supply chains. What is this government doing proactively to look at opportunities in these supply chains that Canadian businesses can take advantage of?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we continue to work with countries around the globe to ensure that Canada's supply chains and those global supply chains, particularly for essential goods, for agricultural products, for medical supplies, continue to remain open. We will keep doing this work.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, on the agriculture side, canola farmers would like to know the status of canola going into China. Can she update the House on that status?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food): Mr.Chair, I want to assure my colleague that we are continuing to work with our industry representatives, our allies and our trading partners in China.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Ms. McLeod.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod (KamloopsThompsonCariboo, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senior Canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early January that China was procuring and hoarding PPE. As a member of cabinet, was the health minister aware?\nHon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Mr. Chair, from the very beginning of the outbreak in early January we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face, and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: In April, the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile. Can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of PPE for China on January 31, claiming it would not compromise our supply? She can't have it both ways. We don't have enough; we have enough and it won't compromise it.\nHon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Mr. Chair, we are operating in a highly competitive global environment, and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time, which we have been doing in the past weeks and months, to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep Canadians safe. That's our priority. That's what we're working on.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Unfortunately, this question was directed to the health minister, referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies. Before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, provinces and territories have their own stockpiles, which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions. We've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support. In fact, of all the requests made so far, we have been able to complete them.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to N95 masks. Did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that PPE she shipped out, providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, the equipment that was donated when China was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus. As the member opposite knows, we've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Mr. Chair, I would suggest that during February and March our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently, but I want to move on to another topic. When defending the sale of 22 seniors' homes to the Chinese government, the Prime Minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards. He said that this regime ensures the care our seniors get is top quality. That was in 2017. Now he states he is saddened, shocked, disappointed and angered. Was the Prime Minister completely oblivious to the risks, or was he just too anxious to please the Chinese government when he sold those 22 homes?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of B.C., and I have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes. The member opposite is trying to confuse the issue. As she knows, the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: The Prime Minister does not have authority over seniors' homes, which he has clearly stated, but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale. At 18 months, government had an obligation to make sure there was compliance. Was that done?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act, and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Under the Investment Canada Act, the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance. Four homes had to close. Since the government approved the sale, it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country\nHon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear that we understand how difficult this is for seniors. That is why we follow the appropriate steps, outlined under the Investment Canada Act, to make sure that any measures we take keep seniors and their well-being first and foremost.\nThe Chair: Mr.Therrien, you now have the floor.\nMr. Alain Therrien (La Prairie, BQ): Mr.Chair, during the pandemic, the government has given money to companies that don't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens. We told the government that it didn't make sense. The government's response was that it is no big deal. During the pandemic, the government gave money to Air Canada, but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for. We told the government that it did not make sense. The government's response was that it was no big deal. During the pandemic, the Liberal Party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities. We told them that it did not make sense. The government responded that it was no big deal. Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal?\nHon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue): Mr.Chair, the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government. We will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes. Let me be clear: in everything we do, we will target companies and not innocent workers. Employees are employees, no matter who they work for.\nMr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, when I see that it's the Minister of National Revenue answering me, I don't feel like buying a lottery ticket. The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign, which seems to indicate that it isn't short of money. However, the Liberals used the emergency wage subsidy. Why? Is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that's experiencing a significant drop in income. That's the approach we've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future. We will continue this approach.\nMr. Alain Therrien: It's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election, yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $7million since the last election. Is the party in jeopardy? Can it go bankrupt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, as I said, our approach is to protect employees. We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future.\nMr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, we still don't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar. We think they may have taken as much as $1million. How many SMEs could have been saved with the $1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we appreciate the question. We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy, the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs. We will continue this approach to help SMEs and their employees.\nMr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, I will propose a choice of answers, or I won't get any. When did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy? Now here are three possible answers. The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy, they set parameters allowing them to use it. The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are, but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy, they thought they could do it too. The third possible answer is that the Liberals hadn't planned to use the subsidy, but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it, because that's what they do.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada. That's our approach, and I believe it's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic.\nThe Chair: We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): We will now resume the discussion.  We'll continue with Ms. Khalid, the honourable member for MississaugaErin Mills.\nMs. Iqra Khalid (MississaugaErin Mills, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be splitting my time with the member for PickeringUxbridge. Mr. Chair, when the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in Ontario at the request of the premier, they released a report that outlined their findings in detail. Military members witnessed residents' cries for help going unanswered. They saw force-feeding. They saw bug infestations, a lack of personal protective equipment and neglect. Canadians are shaken. They are appalled by the horrific conditions outlined in the military report. Almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in Ontario alone, over 25 of them in my riding of MississaugaErin Mills. These deaths could have been prevented. Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, it's such an important question. I believe all Canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the Canadian Armed Forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in Ontario. What's happening to seniors in Ontario is completely unacceptable. The report is very troubling. Seniors deserve to live with dignity, with respect and with safety. While long-term care is provincially regulated, we know that we need to work together. The Government of Canada stands ready to support provinces and territories as they continue to respond to this crisis. I had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work. We also know that seniors want to stay at home longer. That's why our historic investment of $6 billion in home care was so important. We'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now to Ms. O'Connell.\nMs. Jennifer O'Connell (PickeringUxbridge, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will sadly report that my community of Pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single COVID-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country. Seventy residents at Orchard Villa long-term care home died during this pandemic. It was a devastating blow to our community. Yesterday, we received the horrific report from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing what they witnessed at Orchard Villa in Pickering, Altamont Care Community in Scarborough, Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke, Hawthorne Place in North York, and Holland Christian Homes' Grace Manor in Brampton. The loved ones of those who have passed away, as well as the homes' workers, have asked for a full public inquiry from the Ontario government. I know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction, but on behalf of our communities, can the Minister of Health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the Ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full, independent, non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that won't even start until September?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I would say that all Canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes. We're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals. We also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care. We have to do better as a country. These are our loved ones. These are our parents and our grandparents. These are the people in our lives who have given so much to us. I stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society. We know that there's a role we can play at the federal level with advice, with guidance, with support and, yes, with investments. We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now to Mr. Davies from Vancouver Kingsway.\nMr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canadians were horrified to hear the report yesterday from our armed forces about the appalling conditions experienced by seniors in our long-term care homes. Page after page detailed the filth, neglect, abuse and danger our seniors in care are exposed to on a daily basis. Shockingly they face injury and death through missed medications, expired medications, unsterile devices and violations of basic contagion rules to stop the spread of COVID-19. Given that evidence of possible criminal conduct was contained in the military's report, will the minister refer this matter to the RCMP for investigation immediately?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, thanks very much to the member for those expressions of concern, which we share. We understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges, and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable. Considering the severity of this report, we promptly shared it with the Province of Ontario, and the Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report's findings. Their investigation includes alerting the province's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction. We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities, and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross.\nMr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, that's a shocking answer considering there's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this. That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation's RCMP is unacceptable. The seniors care crisis is a national problem. COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada's entire network of long-term care facilities. Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day. As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries, with over 80% of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities. Will this government move swiftly to establish binding national standards for long-term care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes. He's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time, that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors. As the member knows, we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home. We know that is one part of the solution, but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care. That's the work I'm doing now. I'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all.\nMr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, what we need is binding national standards, just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally. Gross fecal contamination, filthy medical equipment, insect infestations, ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada's hospitals. There's no reason to accept them in Canada's long-term care facilities. Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act, or similar legislation, with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors, just like we do for hospitals?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country, not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes, regardless of the province in which they live. We know we need to do better. We know that collectively, at all levels of government, we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years. The member has my commitment that I will work with provinces and territories to find a solution forward to ensure that every person has the right to age with dignity and safety.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Davies, you have 15 seconds for another question, a short one, and leave time for a response.\nMr. Don Davies: Thank you, Mr. Chair. These failures are the product of systemic neglect often motivated by prioritizing profit over the provision of adequate care. Does the minister agree that we should not be putting profits above the health care needs of Canada's seniors?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I believe that, when we commit to taking care of people, we must do so with the utmost care that is required. I know that provinces and territories have a lot of work to do. So do we, at the federal level, and obviously at the local level. We must all work together to protect those people in our lives who are most vulnerable, whether they be seniors, children or others.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now move on to Mr. Schmale, HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock. Mr. Schmale, go ahead.\nMr. Jamie Schmale (HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock, CPC): Thank you, Chair. According to Vaughn Palmer in an editorial in the Vancouver Sun regarding the secret Wet'suwet'en deal, Palmer writes:     The hereditary chiefs calculated the two governments would sign despite the objections from the elected chiefs. They likewise got the terms they wanted in the MOU while giving up absolutely nothing. Just as they figured governments would keep the contents secret from the public.   Can the minister describe another situation in which the federal government negotiated a secret deal of this magnitude with unelected people?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett (Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations): I thank the member for his ongoing concern and I want to remind him that actually it is in keeping with the Supreme Court decision of 1997 that we were to now begin those conversations with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who took the case to the Supreme Court. As we've said many times, this is not an agreement; this is an MOU that establishes the path forward for the substantive discussions towards a final agreement, which would describe the future governance and the implementation of Wet'suwet'en rights and title. It is about a shared commitment.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, if it is a shared commitment, why on the eve of the signing ceremony did the four elected chiefs denounce the hereditary chiefs for keeping them in the dark?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, it's really important that the member understand that there was a process for the hereditary chiefs to go back to their communities and discuss with them. Any agreement after the good work that will happen now would have to go back and seek the approval of all of the communities.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, the Burns Lake Band members are openly wondering if they're still a band or if the few unelected hereditary chiefs will control everything now. Minister, can you assure them that going forward you will honour their concerns and take the time to listen?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I ask honourable members to still direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Actually, the honourable member knows that the next steps include the further and ongoing engagement by the Wet'suwet'en in their house groups and that will include the six elected chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en nation, their community members and many others. This is about going forward and making sure that any\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. Cynthia Joseph, a chief councillor with the Hagwilget First Nation says the MOU between Ottawa, the province and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs was only shared with her community members on May 9, two days after it was published in the media. Is this part of the open and transparent government all Canadians can expect of the Prime Minister?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Walking the path of reconciliation means that we work with our partners and there is a way that they do the work within their communities. It is going to be an agreement to begin the work, but any final agreement is going to have to be approved by all members of the nation in terms of developing a consensus for the agreement\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. Does the minister have any concerns regarding claims by several former female hereditary chiefs that they were stripped of their hereditary status because they didn't agree with the men?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, it is going to be really important that the work take place within the Wet'suwet'en nation to determine their future governance, to determine their way of working with Canada and to make sure\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. For some reason it seems to be a problem to stand up for these hereditary female chiefs who had their titles taken away. Does the minister plan on recognizing band council resolutions denying the authority of hereditary chiefs to sign any future agreements without consent of the elected chiefs and the 3,000 members within the Wet'suwet'en they represent?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: I think the member must understand that, as we begin the work, the nation will do its work and then we will come to the table to determine what the governance would be. Will it be a hybrid model like at Heiltsuk, like Ktunaxa, like some of the communities developing their constitutions, developing their laws and deciding how they will determine their own governance and that partnership with Canada?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus (CharlesbourgHaute-Saint-Charles, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. The current restrictions on non-essential travel at the border do not prevent people from claiming refugee protection if they have family in Canada. Why is the minister refusing to allow married people to cross the border?\nHon. Bill Blair: I want to thank the honourable member for a very important question. We have heard from many constituents and members of Parliament from right across the country who are expressing concern about non-status spouses being denied entry into the country because their travel is deemed to be non-essential. I've recently been in touch with all of the provinces and territories because I think it's very important that we have their support for any changes\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have the floor.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: If I understand correctly, Mr.Minister, you are talking to provincial representatives, but a case like that of ChantalTremblay, for instance, is unacceptable. For two months now, she has been trying to bring her spouse to Canada, but it isn't working. Is there a way to issue a directive to border services officers that married spousesit's often marriages with Americanscan cross the border to join their spouses in Canada?\nHon. Bill Blair: Just to be very clearagain, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify thisit is never our intention to separate families, but at the same time, we have imposed appropriate and necessary restrictions on non-essential travel. Our border services officers inquire of everyone coming to that border about the nature of their travel, and for non-citizens who come to that border seeking entry into Canada, if their entry is deemed non-essential, then they exercise their discretion not to allow\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have the floor.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: Thank you, Mr.Chair. Information from the Canada Border Services Agency has just come out. Since March21, 425,000people have flown into Canada. Among them were 295,000Canadians, which isn't a problem. However, 100,000foreigners have entered Canada, even though the border is supposedly closed. How does the minister explain the fact that 100,000people arrived in Canada by plane?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify. We have imposed very significant restrictions on non-essential travel, but of course there are circumstances where individuals come to this country and their entry into Canada is deemed essential. For example, someone who is providing medical services and coming into Canada to provide those services would be deemed essential, because there is a great need among Canadians for those services. It's dealt with on a case-by-case basis. As you can see by the numbers, we have had a very significant reduction in the travel of all non-Canadians to Canada over the past two months.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: So the minister confirms that the 100,000people who arrived by air were providing a service considered essential to Canada. I'm not talking about the people who crossed the land border, but the people who came to Canada by air.\nHon. Bill Blair: What I can tell you is that at all points of entry, including our air borders, we apply the standard that the travel must be deemed essential, and that determination is utilized to see if a person is eligible to enter into the country.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: We're now learning that the Correctional Service of Canada's investigation into the murder of MarylneLevesque is suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Canadians aren't fooled; they know full well that it is a political decision. All the technological means are available to allow the investigation to continue. I'm proof of that today. Can the minister direct the Correctional Service of Canada to resume the investigation into the death of MarylneLevesque?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, I thank the member for the question, because we know the concern of the people of Quebec, and the family of Ms. Levesque needs answers and deserves answers. That's why we asked the Parole Board and the Correctional Service of Canada to convene a board of investigation. Clearly, during COVID transmission, the ability to conduct that investigation and to interview all of the witnesses became extremely difficult and has been temporarily suspended, but at the very earliest opportunity we remain resolute to resume that investigation and get to the bottom of it to provide the answers that the family deserves.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have only 20seconds remaining.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: Mr.Chair, victims of crime are one of the segments of the population most affected by the crisis. As we know, the government refuses to allow victims of crime to participate in parole hearings. For the first time in its history, and to add insult to injury, the government has cancelled all activities related to Victims and Survivors of Crime Week, which was to take place next week. Why is the Prime Minister turning his back on victims?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, at the earliest days of COVID, until arrangements could be put in place, there were restrictions on victims participating. We have put the systems in place to allow victims to present their evidence virtually, either by video or by phone, to ensure that their voices are heard in these important things. We very much respect and support the role of victims in these determinations, and we're making every effort to ensure that they can participate.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now to Mr. Cumming, Edmonton Centre.\nMr. James Cumming (Edmonton Centre, CPC): Mr. Chair, yesterday I asked the Minister of Small Business how many business credit availability guarantees were issued by EDC, and I didn't get a number. Does she have an exact, finite, number of the guarantees today?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, thank you to the honourable member for that question. Our government has taken swift and immediate action to support Canadian businesses through this time. Money from this program is flowing, and businesses across the country are receiving the important support that they need.\nMr. James Cumming: How many BCAP applications have been received so far?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, these are large loans, and they require important due diligence and adjudication by the financial institutions. We will continue to be open and transparent as the accurate information becomes available.\nMr. James Cumming: How long does it take to be approved for a BCAP guarantee?\nHon. Mary Ng: I want to assure the member that we're going to do everything possible to support businesses and workers during this very important time.\nMr. James Cumming: How many businesses have received funding under the BCAP co-lending program since March?\nHon. Mary Ng: The lending programs, particularly the program to help small businesses, have really helped lots of businesses. Over 630,000 loans have been issued, and this is really helping those\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: Unfortunately, lots is not an answer for the businesses that I'm trying to talk to. Can you tell me, for the CEBA changes that were recently announced, when will we be able to see people who have income through a dividend able to apply?\nHon. Mary Ng: That's a very important question, Mr. Chair. There's nothing more important to me and to our government than getting these supports out to businesses. Those small businesses that will meet the expanded CEBA criteria are working very diligently with the financial institutions to make sure that they can get access to those loans as quickly as possible.\nMr. James Cumming: Can the minister give me a day when that will happen?\nHon. Mary Ng: The financial institutions are working very hard to make sure that they can make this available to businesses.\nMr. James Cumming: When will a sole proprietor be able to go for those loans?\nHon. Mary Ng: We will work very hard and very diligently to make sure that these businesses and those sole proprietors are supported.\nMr. James Cumming: Could they go on Monday?\nHon. Mary Ng: There is nothing more important than making sure these businesses weather the difficult time of COVID-19, and our measures are\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: How about Tuesday?\nHon. Mary Ng: I think we will all agree that getting support to these businesses is absolutely crucial. Our commitment is always going to be to get support to these businesses.\nMr. James Cumming: I can't get a distinct answer on any of those questions. Can you tell me how much headroom is left on the CEBA program?\nHon. Mary Ng: Today, over 630,000 businesses have received the support to do things like pay for salaries, the 25% top-up for the wage subsidy, pay for rent and pay for insurance and utilities. This is what these loans are helping our small\nMr. James Cumming: How many dollars are left in the program so businesses can have some certainty that the program will be available for some time?\nHon. Mary Ng: I think you will see that the businesses across the country that I have talked to really appreciate that the government has stepped up to help them during this difficult time. These include women with businesses, indigenous-owned businesses and those small businesses all across our communities, all across the country, that are getting the necessary help. We are going to keep\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: How many dollars? It can't be that complicated. How many dollars?\nHon. Mary Ng: There are 630,000 businesses that are getting help, and thousands more businesses will be getting help with the expanded criteria. We're going to keep doing the work that we need to help our businesses across this country through this difficult time.\nMr. James Cumming: I heard from a constituent in my riding that they waited for over four hours on the portal for CECRA. Is there an issue with the portal, and if so, when will it be fixed?\nHon. Mary Ng: Making sure that businesses get the help for commercial rent support is absolutely crucial right now. We are going to endeavour to make sure that this help gets out to those small businesses. Applications have opened in a staggered way and\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one last short question, Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: Finally, the Prime Minister yesterday said that a list of all organizations that have been receiving CEWS will be made public. When will that be done?\nHon. Mary Ng: We have committed to making sure that those companies taking the wage subsidy program will be listed publicly. We have committed to doing that and we will do so.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We now go to Mr. d'Entremont from West Nova. Mr. d'Entremont, go ahead.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have a question for the Minister of Fisheries, but I thought I would say this first. The Canadian Coast Guard is doing a search at this moment following the loss of a vessel off the coast of Newfoundland. From my community, which is a seafaring, fishing community, I just want to put my thoughts out there to the folks of Newfoundland. We are definitely thinking of them during this difficult time. My first question revolves around the lobster fishery. It's been open in Cape Breton since May 15, I believe. The weather has been good. The harvesters have been going at it every day. The price has dropped to $4.25 already. Unstable markets will probably cause it to drop even more. What is the minister doing to make sure the lobster industry survives?\nHon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank my colleague for his comments with regard to the tragic accident off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, where we saw the loss of life in a fishing accident. Of course, as coastal people, we are all in solidarity with the people of Newfoundland right now. We know that the fish and seafood sector has taken extreme hits because of COVID-19. We're working diligently to make sure we support the industry as best we can. We have made available over half a billion dollars to processors and harvesters to make sure they can weather this storm. We have made sure that the harvesters are able to access the harvester benefit as well as the grant, recognizing the unique nature of their business and how they are not able to access some of our other programs. We are continuing to monitor what is happening in the industry. We will continue to make sure we do everything we can to support the fish and seafood sector.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, to continue along this vein for a moment, we are still looking at unstable markets for a longer period of time. At this point, processors are being selective in what they're buying. They're not buying culls and other kinds of lobsters. The plants are filling up, and harvesters are worried that they might stop buying product before the season is complete. What can the fishermen expect, or what kinds of programs can they expect, if the season goes bust?\nHon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, we know that this is a very challenging season for our harvesters. We also know that because of the decline in markets, we've had to make accommodations for the processing sector in order to help them be better able to support the harvesters. We have put in $62.5 million, which is allowing the processors to increase capacity in their refrigeration and freezers so that they will continue to be able to purchase product. As I said earlier, we will continue to monitor the situation and make sure we do everything possible to support our harvesters. This is a very difficult\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. d'Entremont.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, I don't know whether this next question will go to the Minister of DFO or the Minister of Transport. Oakley Ryerson is a resident of West Nova. He is planning a career on the sea and wants to get his master class four. The problem is that he can't pass the eye exam. He needs full-colour vision. For those who are far-sighted or nearsighted, you just have to put on your glasses to correct it. You can actually fly airplanes. I don't know about space shuttles, but who knows? You can now wear colour-corrected lenses, but Transport Canada still does not recognize these for use. Can the Minister of Transport help Ryerson in attaining his chosen profession?\nHon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport): Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concern of my colleague for one of the residents in his riding. I would ask him to write to me and lay out the situation. We have medical standards with respect to a number of different kinds of transportation-related jobs for pilots, mariners and those kinds of occupations, which have to be respected. However, if he sends me the details, I will look into it personally.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. d'Entremont, you have another 20 to 25 seconds left.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the eligibility criteria for financial support include the need to demonstrate a significant loss of income during the months of March and April, yet several SMEs in the tourism industry can't qualify because their operations start with the tourist season, in late May or early June. What will the government do to help them?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, before accessing the emergency wage subsidy, applicants must meet important criteria. However, as we explained last week, we will be adjusting the wage subsidy until the end of August, and we will be reviewing the criteria.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We're going to go to the west coast and the member for SaanichGulf Islands. Ms. May, go ahead.\nMs. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. My question is with regard to the urgent problem of mental health crises across Canada. My colleague, Jenica Atwin from Fredericton, held a press conference this morning in which she used the term echo pandemic. We will face an echo pandemic. We're already seeing increases in suicides on southern Vancouver Island. My question to the minister is this: Will we see direct funding to community mental health services as urgently requested by the Canadian Mental Health Association?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I read the honourable member's colleague's letter just today, and I want to reassure all members that we have invested in mental health supports for Canadians, obviously before the pandemic hit but certainly since we've been living with the pandemic. I'd like to remind all members to direct their constituents to the wellnesstogether.ca website and portal. There Canadians can find online resources, as well as connections to real and alive counsellors and other professionals who can help them with their various concerns.\nMs. Elizabeth May: This question relates to another current emergency: the climate emergency. This week it was reported that the concentration of greenhouse gases reached 417 parts per million. That's not just unprecedented over thousands of years; that's unprecedented over the last one million years. The temperatures in the Arctic broke 86F, 30C in the Arctic circle. The recognized parties in the House have established standing committees to work, but not the committee on the environment. We've asked for this in negotiations. When will the recognized parties remember the June 2019 emergency resolution that we are in a climate emergency, and start making sure that we hit 2020 commitments under the Paris Agreement to improve our targets?\nHon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's questions. I will remind her that we have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. We've also committed to surpassing the targets that we had originally set for 2030. We realize that along with the COVID pandemic, which is the major problem that exists in the world today, there is another problem as well that affects the entire planet, and that is the problem associated with climate change. We remain committed to achieving those targets.\nMs. Elizabeth May: My next question will be for Minister Blair, but as an aside, I will say that last answer completely fails to meet the legal requirements of the Paris Agreement to file a new target this year. To save some time, Minister Blair, let's pretend to go back to the questions from my colleague MP Paul-Hus and to your last answer. This is dealt with on a case-by-case basis by CBSA agents. There are thousands of them. They are exercising personal, subjective judgment. This is not acceptable. I'm begging the minister. Could the minister please put out a directive, advice to every CBSA agent on the ground, that when a non-status entry point sees a non-status direct relativehusband, wife, child of a Canadian citizenthat relative be deemed to be entering Canada for an essential purpose?\nHon. Bill Blair: I'd like to thank the member for bringing this issue forward again. It's an important one. We have been working very hard to ensure that we do everything possible to keep families together. At the same time, we've been working with the provinces and territories, listening to the concerns of Canadians about ensuring that travel across our international border, particularly with the United States, is limited to essential travel. As I've indicated, I've had a number of important conversations and necessary conversations with our provincial and territorial partners. I believe there is a consensus on the right way forward on this, and we're working very diligently to put it in place. I want to assure the member opposite that we have given very clear direction to our CBSA officers. I believe our border services officers have been doing an extraordinary job for us in the exercise of their discretion. At the same time, they have been doing the important work of ensuring the health and safety of Canadians at our border.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We're now going to Ms. Kwan for Vancouver East. Ms. Kwan, go ahead.\nMs. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP): Four out of the five homes listed in the armed forces report were for-profit. It is painfully clear that corporate profits are being put ahead of the well-being of seniors. Will the minister admit that the for-profit model is failing our loved ones and commit to getting profits out of long-term care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: As the member opposite notes, nobody can read that report or hear those stories without feeling absolute horror and disgust and without demanding better for the elders in our lives. As I have mentioned many times in the House, our government remains committed to working with provinces and territories to ensure that every elder person in our community can age with dignity and in safety.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: Minister, if that's the case, I will ask again. Will the minister make sure that the focus of long-term care homes is taking care of seniors and not taking care of owners' bank accounts?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: As the member will obviously know, long-term care remains in the jurisdiction of provinces and territories, and there is legislation that rules them as such. As the member also knows, we have stood by Ontario and all of the other provinces and territories throughout this outbreak. The Prime Minister has been very clear\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will go back to Ms. Kwan.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: Is the minister refusing to answer the question because she agrees that profit should come before care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: I think it's unfortunate that the member is trying to place words in my mouth. What I do agree with, though, is that long-term care needs to be reformed, and I think all provinces and territories know, and all Canadians know, that we have to do a better job.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: It's simple for the minister. She can just answer the question. Is she willing to defend for-profit care for our seniors? Is she in favour of for-profit private health care too?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: What I am willing to defend is the right for all Canadians to age with safety and dignity.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: To the minister, what is the difference? Why sell out the care of our seniors? Will she commit that she will take profit out of long-term care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I think the member opposite knows that the only way to actually reform long-term care is to work with provinces and territories, in fact, all levels of government, to ensure that the people who spent their lives caring for and nurturing us can end their lives with caring and nurturing\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will go back to Ms. Kwan.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: I think the minister knows that what we need is national standards for seniors' care. The Revera long-term care homes are owned by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Since the government owns these homes, has the military been sent in there to see what's happening to seniors under their care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, we know that it is important to work with all of the provinces and territories under whose jurisdiction it falls to protect the seniors within those care homes. That's what we've been doing since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus, and that's what we'll continue to do to protect the lives of seniors and strengthen their protection. We will, as I said, Mr. Chair, work with the provinces and territories to have a longer-term plan so that all seniors can age with dignity and safety.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: The government has a clear responsibility here. What is the government doing to ensure the standards of care in these Revera homes that they own?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as I have repeatedly said, the jurisdiction for care of long-term care homes falls within the provincial and territorial realm. However, that being said, Mr. Chair, we have been there for provinces and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus, and as the member opposite has clearly or likely heard the Prime Minister say, we will stand with provinces and territories as all elders have the right to age with dignity\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Kwan.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: I didn't hear an answer, Mr. Chair, so the answer is nothing, then. Do you think that the families of the seniors in these homes want to hear those excuses about jurisdictional issues? Does the minister not think that the families want to hear that the federal government is doing all it can to care for their parents?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I would remind the members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Quite frankly, I don't think that families care which level of government is responsible for caring for their elders. I think what they care about is that their elders are cared for. That's in fact what the Prime Minister believes. That's in fact what our government believes, and that's why we have willingly stepped up to say to provinces and territories that we will be there with you to make sure that all seniors in our lives have the right to age with dignity and care.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now give the floor to Mrs.Gill, from the riding of Manicouagan. Go ahead, Mrs.Gill.\nMrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ): Mr.Chair, my question is for the Prime Minister who, earlier, clearly told us that the government's assistance is intended for those who are most in need and most vulnerable. I come from a riding where a lot of people make their living from the tourism industry. I don't know if the PrimeMinister read the newspapers yesterday, but in Quebec, losses to the tune of $4billion are expected until March2021 in the tourism accommodation sector alone. The service sector will lose 93,000jobs. How can I justify to my constituents the fact that a political party, which does not need it, has already seen money from the emergency wage subsidy, when people in my riding don't yet have access to it because of the seasonal nature of their work? These people haven't seen the money that is available through these programs.\nHon. Bill Morneau: We think it is very important to protect the country's employees in all sectors of the economy. Through this approach, there will be more jobs after the pandemic, and the economic situation will be better. We will continue this approach.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, this is the wrong approach. They are saying that they are protecting the jobs of the Liberal Party of Canada, which does not need the money. I'll ask a question similar to the previous one. Fishers in my riding did not qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. Another program was created for them, which isn't quite the same and doesn't really meet their needs. A government whose political wingnot the parliamentary wingdoesn't really need money takes money from the fund, but leaves fishers to make do with less generous programs that don't meet their needs. What do I tell the fishers in my riding?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that many sectors of the economy across the country are facing challenges. That's why we have adopted an approach with consistent criteria for all employees in all sectors. We have also introduced specific measures to help certain sectors, such as the fishing industry. We will continue our approach because we believe it's the best way to protect employees and our economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I'm still not satisfied. The government is saying that the best way to proceed is to give money to the political wing of the Liberal Party of Canada, when there are people who are getting nothing. What am I supposed to tell seasonal workers, who have absolutely no assurances for their future? I can't go back to my riding and say I'm proud of the work the government is doing or our efforts in the House. It's true, the House is closed right now. I forgot. I have a very hard time accepting that the government is helping employees of the Liberal Party in preparation for the next election campaign, when communities in my region are dying because their economies revolve around a single industry. I can't tell them I'm not ashamed of what's going on as we speak.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.",

And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display .

And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you {disfmarker} it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh {gap} it won't have to burst uh like in the {disfmarker} in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons\nMarketing: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh if you {gap} push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the {disfmarker} for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .\nMarketing: Yeah . But , thi i uh {disfmarker} This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,\nIndustrial Designer: Not with an L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: not .\nProject Manager: No , isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .\nProject Manager: But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you don't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Th then you'll see it on the television .\nProject Manager: Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah\nProject Manager: but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . The television must do that . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control .\nProject Manager: Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yes . But that won't be a problem . I think .\nProject Manager: Most the times that are not advanced televisions .\nIndustrial Designer: No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Cause it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That's important .\nMarketing: I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .\nIndustrial Designer: That's true .\nMarketing: And that might uh bring back the costs uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: But then we'll {disfmarker} I think we must discuss who {disfmarker} uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: I can uh look on my uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's very important .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} Uh {disfmarker} Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Doesn't say . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: That's from my manufacturing division .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Well , thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes ?\nMarketing: My turn ?\nProject Manager: Next .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm . So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . {vocalsound} 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend {disfmarker} uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel {disfmarker} have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's {disfmarker} it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be {disfmarker} uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .\nIndustrial Designer: Changing covers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . Any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: Nope .\nProject Manager: No . It's clear .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: So now , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Ah , let's see . Now , w we have to decide {vocalsound} Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at {disfmarker} 'S next . Components and user interface concept . So {disfmarker} Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , a concept on uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , but if I paint with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I'll paint . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Something like this ? Or {disfmarker} Shapes or {disfmarker} What do we need ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yes . What ?\nMarketing: Can make several uh concepts .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nMarketing: We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: More like something {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah I I I uh {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: M like {disfmarker} Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it .\nProject Manager: And you have to .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I have to .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm not a designer . It's more {gap} three D_ . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's like a gun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: A g {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it has to be soft ?\nMarketing: Mm . {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: And it has to be soft , yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . And uh , the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: So , you can squeeze in it and {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nProject Manager: Buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Buttons on top of it . And here . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} No , it won't .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?\nIndustrial Designer: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .\nUser Interface: But but how {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the b\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . How {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Or two buttons .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , two scroll uh wheels .\nMarketing: And i if we go to uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: If uh {disfmarker} 'Kay c If we do {disfmarker} If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's th that's more difficult .\nMarketing: But if we have uh a me Yeah .\nProject Manager: It's better in {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?\nIndustrial Designer: with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because uh , from h hundred uh {gap} remote controls , ninety nine have it .\nProject Manager: But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .\nMarketing: Uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but {vocalsound} again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You don't know . So , there's no menu .\nIndustrial Designer: I don't know . It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . So you can't use it .\nIndustrial Designer: And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .\nProject Manager: Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . But you all like this kind of thing . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Good concept . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: With the scroll button .\nProject Manager: That's one .\nIndustrial Designer: And and this one has to be soft .\nMarketing: Uh-uh .\nIndustrial Designer: And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: It's one . Two . Number two .\nUser Interface: And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Like uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah that's nice .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Here . Trigger . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No . {vocalsound} But when you handle it , you put it on and off .\nUser Interface: Just to uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's not good to use .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but {vocalsound} I'll zap .\nUser Interface: Oh , like a {vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Fuck . Out . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , it's not good .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . Then uh {disfmarker} Paint it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Paint it ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: With the scroll thing on , like this ?\nProject Manager: One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .\nIndustrial Designer: So ?\nProject Manager: And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Draw it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Unbelievable .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Not so difficult .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: But if you put {disfmarker} push the the menu button {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface: Yeah , wh what {disfmarker} Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .\nProject Manager: You have to {disfmarker} For the menu .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . One that way . And one that way . So {disfmarker} Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um\nIndustrial Designer: Separate , more separate , h yeah .\nMarketing: more separate , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nMarketing: Like , you have the menu button in between uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have a big uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good . Is it better ? When you uh {gap} the menu , you have to go there there there there .\nIndustrial Designer: I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: They were like round curves , uh different uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , okay , okay .\nProject Manager: First the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um {disfmarker} The mute button .\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nMarketing: We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the {disfmarker} to to uh {disfmarker} have to uh {disfmarker} numbers\nProject Manager: Mute . And the other .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Not so difficult .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} But , uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .\nProject Manager: But how do you wanna solve it ?\nIndustrial Designer: With the switch button .\nProject Manager: Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .\nIndustrial Designer: No\nProject Manager: Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .\nIndustrial Designer: like uh {disfmarker} Oh , you mean like that .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , then you can also have like uh th um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: A joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , and joystick , I think .\nProject Manager: Yeah . But is it uh {disfmarker} Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi\nProject Manager: Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I don't know .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . Why do I pay you for ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um , well {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Better ideas . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And {disfmarker} {gap} No , no . It won't work .\nProject Manager: For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Think we have to keep them .\nIndustrial Designer: Or a remote control more like joystick .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but is it {disfmarker} That's not expensive than uh {disfmarker} Joystick is better . A small one .\nIndustrial Designer: A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k\nProject Manager: No just like in a\nIndustrial Designer: Playstation thing .\nProject Manager: a laptop . Small , round .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then it's not so big .\nIndustrial Designer: No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control .\nProject Manager: Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} Maybe , if it's possible , {vocalsound} it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: A small one . So , please look at it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No , that's okay , I got {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they're not uh in details .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah we {disfmarker} I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Then I have to come with it .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .\nProject Manager: Your problem . Not mine .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Then I'll uh make something up .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Then it's {disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager: No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager: So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager: Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer: Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager: Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager: If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager: If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager: {gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer: If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager: No . No , no .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing: Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: And then you can y\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing: If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing: If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager: If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager: Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer: It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's good good .\nUser Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer: Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager: Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing: Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing: {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing: {gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh .\nUser Interface: No , that's true .\nMarketing: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer: This is something new .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager: I think . No .\nMarketing: No . You have more .\nProject Manager: More . Seven .\nMarketing: You have still ten .\nProject Manager: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager: You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Paint it .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Now you have to .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Cookie .\nMarketing: What ? Okay .\nProject Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: See you at the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Bye bye .",

Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ?\nProject Manager: I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Huh .\nProject Manager: I don't know .

So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: why not ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer: Go ahead .\nUser Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: um f we call it fruity\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing: Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing: It is an option .\nUser Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer: That's this here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah . I see .\nUser Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen ,\nProject Manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok\nIndustrial Designer: I thought that was kinda nice .\nMarketing: Nice .\nIndustrial Designer: This was actually an apple on the inside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: This {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um {vocalsound} it's encased in a new uh type of uh\nMarketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: polymer yeah .\nMarketing: we don't need to worry ,\nIndustrial Designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves ,\nUser Interface: It's fine .\nMarketing: okay .\nIndustrial Designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: Fair enough .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It's pos a possible new product .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's a couple years off at least . Okay .\nUser Interface: Um , but I think that's {disfmarker} I think that sums up the main features of our {disfmarker} of the remote ,\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh {disfmarker} whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh we did , yeah . This cost {disfmarker} well to put this into um production , we're looking at about {disfmarker} what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um , so I was quite pleased with that .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: One thing that we didn't do um {disfmarker} obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down .\nProject Manager: Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?\nIndustrial Designer: And {disfmarker} Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?\nUser Interface: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: and um , I think that uh has given a proven um {vocalsound} ease of use and what not .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .\nMarketing: Right .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Any questions ?\nProject Manager: No , no\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ?\nProject Manager: I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , do you wanna answer this one\nMarketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ?\nIndustrial Designer: or do you want me to answer it ?\nUser Interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: Oh I see ,\nMarketing: I just didn't know {disfmarker} if you guys had any in mind yet . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: right , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , well {vocalsound} as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . Just veneer really ,\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .\nMarketing: And the whole thing {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay\nUser Interface: So I mean there are {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Right\nUser Interface: we definitely priced out a spongy {disfmarker} even spongier non-natural look um materials\nMarketing: Yeah . There's {disfmarker} Okay .\nUser Interface: which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .\nMarketing: Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool .\nIndustrial Designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: that in the factory it could {disfmarker} we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: if you know what I mean .\nMarketing: Yep . It's still an option if we need it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Very cool , nice job .\nProject Manager: Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant . {vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound} what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me {disfmarker} you've got {disfmarker} you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nProject Manager: and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um .\nIndustrial Designer: Ooh .\nProject Manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like {disfmarker} So we'll just {disfmarker} if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this {disfmarker} it's a solar cell thing right ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right\nProject Manager: With a back-up battery ?\nIndustrial Designer: uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there ,\nProject Manager: With the ba okay . Um\nIndustrial Designer: yep .\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that {disfmarker} be the general {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um . And um a special {disfmarker} I guess it's uh {disfmarker} we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that {disfmarker} throughout ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , special .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's it's quite unique .\nIndustrial Designer: I like to think of it as unconventional .\nProject Manager: I like it , yeah it's {disfmarker} So it looks like\nMarketing: M come in at sixteen ?\nProject Manager: a bit over budget , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . Huh , doesn't match up does it ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells {vocalsound} um or take out the back-up battery . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: How do you feel about that ?\nUser Interface: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that {disfmarker} you know what the sell is on that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: what am I gonna do ?\nMarketing: Mm k .\nIndustrial Designer: People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery ,\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .\nProject Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now ,\nMarketing: Nah .\nProject Manager: it would have to be {disfmarker} seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental {disfmarker} I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing\nMarketing: I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I mean that's what sets us apart\nMarketing: Which , it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: right ?\nMarketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here\nMarketing: Right . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here\nProject Manager: It's either or .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . I guess we might have to do that .\nMarketing: I think unfortunately that's our best option .\nIndustrial Designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: um and we can't get rid of the uh {disfmarker} I mean removing the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Savings .\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a {vocalsound} mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials .\nMarketing: Mm-mm .\nProject Manager: Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it's a major change but {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright , so\nIndustrial Designer: Gotta do what you gotta do .\nProject Manager: we're in agreement on that .\nMarketing: Unfortunately I think we are .\nUser Interface: No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over .\nMarketing: That would be me . Um cord ?\nProject Manager: Ah of course , sorry .\nMarketing: No problem .\nProject Manager: Whoosh .\nMarketing: Can you reach ,\nUser Interface: Yep .\nMarketing: that would be great , thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That'd be great {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I didn't even do that one on purpose either ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um {vocalsound} from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of {disfmarker} these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Really good .\nMarketing: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . {vocalsound} So .\nUser Interface: They like that spongy feel .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . It looks like it's going over well , so\nUser Interface: And the paging function works well ,\nIndustrial Designer: Six ?\nUser Interface: that's good to hear ,\nMarketing: we're we're good yeah .\nUser Interface: we worked hard on that one .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer: We did .\nMarketing: Yeah . It's {disfmarker} I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .\nIndustrial Designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel\nMarketing: That's everything from me .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: but it's okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ?\nProject Manager: Um yeah ,\nUser Interface: W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again\nProject Manager: I was just {disfmarker} go on .\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nUser Interface: that we're {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ?\nIndustrial Designer: True .\nUser Interface: I guess that's true .\nProject Manager: Right . So , um , {vocalsound} this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um {vocalsound} our project process um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um {vocalsound} uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: As in within the team or ?\nProject Manager: I think so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: I think it's {disfmarker} I mm-hmm , I think so . I think {vocalsound} hope I'm not screwing up an experiment {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nMarketing: It is now ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: you're in charge there you go {vocalsound} . so {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Whatever {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: Um right , um so any thoughts ?\nIndustrial Designer: Are we considering these points here ?\nMarketing: Um .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: I think they're starting blocks yeah .\nProject Manager: What do you guys feel about the process ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were {vocalsound} relatively productive ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .\nUser Interface: We didn't use the whiteboard at all .\nProject Manager: No , no whiteboard . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} No , we didn't . We could now if that'd make up for it\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .\nUser Interface: Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything .\nMarketing: Yeah I think I was taking {vocalsound} notes more often than usual\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's true .\nMarketing: just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Uh .\nProject Manager: Was pretty cool tack though .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Definitely .\nMarketing: Mm . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: As you write your personal coach .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , but I didn't get a response {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What if you get a response two or three months from now ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: we'll see {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That'd be weird .\nMarketing: Okay that would be kinda creepy .\nProject Manager: Attempts to contact coach ineffective {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever {disfmarker} basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .\nMarketing: I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: With the natural look .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Very natural look .\nIndustrial Designer: That's very natural .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Organic , really . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's the brilliance of {disfmarker} they had a p they had a peeler in here .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: which is always a plus .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think the teamwork was good as well .\nMarketing: Mm yeah , I'm impressed .\nIndustrial Designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice . All four of those little containers . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I guess {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: we only had four , wasn't enough .\nMarketing: You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I know it could have been amazing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh well .\nProject Manager: What did you guys think about the the the roles ?\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: They were good {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough .\nMarketing: True .\nIndustrial Designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Do your own .\nIndustrial Designer: which was kind of fun .\nMarketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all .\nProject Manager: That's true , I I got this spreadsheet {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Nothing , I didn't even get an email ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: like\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped .\nUser Interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Whatever .\nProject Manager: Of what to do .\nUser Interface: well no but also {disfmarker} yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , that wasn't very much . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: You know {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: because that was kind of the interface portion\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: which was what the whole project was about\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Mm , mm .\nUser Interface: uh\nMarketing: Hmm , very much so .\nUser Interface: but {disfmarker} and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you\nUser Interface: which was fine . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .\nMarketing: Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . Very much so .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nUser Interface: And I think your leadership was quite good .\nIndustrial Designer: It was really good yeah .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off {gap} boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get {disfmarker} I I felt like I got way too into it .\nMarketing: Yeah . That's kind of a good thing though ,\nProject Manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot .\nIndustrial Designer: It's kinda fun .\nMarketing: you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey .\nProject Manager: I dunno .\nUser Interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ?\nProject Manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap ,\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: it's one thing to do , you know {disfmarker} set up a party with your friends ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: you know ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Little different .\nProject Manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the {disfmarker} okay ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I had to admit , as soon as w we started {disfmarker} I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , {vocalsound} th {vocalsound} you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: other than that {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I could only imagine . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too ,\nUser Interface: Possibly .\nProject Manager: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos {disfmarker} did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh yeah ,\nMarketing: Yeah . Totally .\nProject Manager: everybody knows {disfmarker} best spaceships ever .\nUser Interface: still have 'em .\nProject Manager: Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nMarketing: I think so .\nUser Interface: Yep .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} You don't .\nProject Manager: I don't {disfmarker} I I was just {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Though we didn't actually {disfmarker} I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't {disfmarker} except for the actual building ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: It's true huh ?\nMarketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board {disfmarker} well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . I mean\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's true .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team {vocalsound} you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It d\nMarketing: Yeah that is kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But yeah . Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? I mean the whole process of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Wonder why {disfmarker} is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?\nProject Manager: I don't know . {vocalsound} I I don't know if there was a ri I th\nMarketing: Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's it\nMarketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .\nMarketing: Yeah . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option ,\nProject Manager: Nor I .\nMarketing: I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't .\nUser Interface: I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for .\nMarketing: True .\nUser Interface: Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me .\nProject Manager: I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper .\nMarketing: Yeah . Well it looks really professional .\nProject Manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized\nMarketing: I know .\nProject Manager: because my handwriting is crap .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something .\nIndustrial Designer: that's it . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here .\nUser Interface: So is this all we need to get through ?\nProject Manager: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .\nMarketing: I guess .\nIndustrial Designer: New ideas .\nMarketing: Um .\nUser Interface: Is it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It {disfmarker} did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?\nProject Manager: Well , that's the thing I got {disfmarker} i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there ,\nMarketing: That slide was like that ?\nProject Manager: mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Well .\nProject Manager: Um ch\nIndustrial Designer: I guess we're on the right track .\nProject Manager: Yeah well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: W {gap} {vocalsound} I kinda like th\nIndustrial Designer: No , none .\nMarketing: Uh I think they still do their job .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah you can't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I think they're fine actually .\nMarketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different .\nMarketing: I don't {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: you know ? {vocalsound} Don't know .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um . 'Kay .\nUser Interface: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ?\nProject Manager: So this was other costs .\nMarketing: Kind of .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we back into project mood ?\nProject Manager: I dunno . I think this is\nMarketing: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ?\nProject Manager: forty ish\nMarketing: How much time do we have left ?\nProject Manager: I I I mm we should go on a bit {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} about the project eval , um . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what like you know what am I really doing ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: you know what is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: and I was like {disfmarker} had like all this brainstorming I was doing\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Why ?\nProject Manager: Hey .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so type away . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Huh I think it was the real {gap} .\nMarketing: You know , you know what I mean\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: Definitely when {vocalsound} when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to {disfmarker} how much I stressed over it\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .\nMarketing: Whatever . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very much , yeah .\nUser Interface: which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I actually didn't do that at all though ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: every single one I {disfmarker} a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di\nUser Interface: Oh I added like five slides too ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} See\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: Did you really ?\nUser Interface: but I {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I only got blank ones .\nIndustrial Designer: I just got blank ones\nProject Manager: What ? Really ?\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe\nUser Interface: Yeah , mine too .\nMarketing: and they were just empty .\nProject Manager: Did they not have {disfmarker} they didn't like {disfmarker} uh mine {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Me too .\nProject Manager: yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with {disfmarker} this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like ,\nMarketing: Like with those words already on it ?\nProject Manager: literally , just like that .\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Interesting .\nMarketing: I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh-huh huh huh .\nIndustrial Designer: I deleted slides {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think I added a slide one time .\nUser Interface: I added many slides every time {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Hey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .\nUser Interface: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Interesting . Any other thoughts come to mind ?\nMarketing: I wanna know how our product would fare .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I think it would fail , I think\nMarketing: I can't just leave it there .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . {vocalsound} But you know the whole {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Even you {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: I don't {disfmarker} we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I know it is {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: It's a happy face .\nUser Interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Builds . Mm .\nUser Interface: I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I I noticed that . {vocalsound} By accident .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that happened to be consumed . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Interesting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Well huh . An interesting day all in all I would say .\nProject Manager: Uh , yeah , I'd say so .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not .\nProject Manager: Mm , I know .\nMarketing: I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce\nIndustrial Designer: I wanna see a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I Yeah .\nProject Manager: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . Well the id okay the notion of {disfmarker}\nMarketing: 'Cause it's such a functional item .\nProject Manager: yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . You know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of {disfmarker} we sh I I thought of I thought of {disfmarker} rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: I dunno . But . All in all it's kinda interesting .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: We got it to be .\nProject Manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager: Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: Yay .\nProject Manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager: Oh yeah .\nMarketing: that mean nothing .\nProject Manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer: Really .\nUser Interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Filler words or ?\nProject Manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer: Disfluencies .\nMarketing: That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nMarketing: I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface: That's scary\nIndustrial Designer: It is scary .\nUser Interface: yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing: I yeah .\nUser Interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing: True .\nProject Manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing: I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: In the eighties ?\nMarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface: Right .\nMarketing: because it hadn't been\nUser Interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface: You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing: I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager: Cool .\nIndustrial Designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where do you find that ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface: There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Huh ?\nProject Manager: W oh .\nIndustrial Designer: That's awesome .\nUser Interface: Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing: So is that a close ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager: Fab .\nMarketing: Thank you gentlemen .

            "context": "The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.\nMs. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.\nMr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.\nThe Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.\nMr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.\nThe Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Anandasangaree.\nMr. Gary Anandasangaree (ScarboroughRouge Park, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I speak today with a very heavy heart. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes. I'm thankful for the Canadian Armed Forces who were deployed to the Altamont care home in my riding and four other facilities across the GTA. The CAF have brought forward horrifying allegations in the operation of these homes. They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time; being forcibly fed, causing choking; being bed-bound for weeks; receiving inadequate nutrition, and much more. Mr. Chair, I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations. I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario. Finally, Mr. Chair, we need to work with the provinces and territories to set national standards of care for the most vulnerable in our society. We can and must do better. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nThe Chair: We have a point of order. Go ahead, Ms. May.\nMs. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hesitate to interrupt colleagues, but I'm concerned about the petition practice, which, as I understand it, is to summarize a petition but not make a speech. I felt one of our colleagues was trespassing on our usual rules.\nThe Chair: I will remind honourable members that when a petition is presented, we're expected to give a prcis and make it as concise as possible. Thank you. Mr.Champoux, you have the floor.\nMr. Martin Champoux (Drummond, BQ): Mr.Chair, I would like to recognize the resilience of Quebeckers concerned for their jobs or their businesses during the COVID-19 crisis. They need us to plan for after the crisis, and we must do so now. To do so, we need the proper information. We need to know the status of the public finances. That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June17. This is not about making a spectacle. Everyone knows that the deficit will be huge. We had to provide the people with support and we all agree on that. But we have to know to what extent. We also have to know where we are starting from so that we can plan where we are going. This is about respecting the public, because they are the ones who will be paying the bill. In closing, I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada. The Liberals promised to correct this injustice. Now is a great time for them to do so.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Sidhu.\nMs. Sonia Sidhu (Brampton South, Lib.): Mr. Chair, this week is National Paramedic Services Week. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police, paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe. In my riding, organizations have stepped up to help our community. Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society, the Interfaith Council of Peel, the Brampton YMCA, the Prayer Stone Peoples Church, Unity in the Community, Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, Knights Table, the Yogi Divine Society, Vraj Community Service, Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time. I also have to address the report that came out yesterday from our brave Canadian Armed Forces. Like many Canadians, I was shocked by this report from the long-term care centres, including one in my riding. The examples of abuse described in the report are unacceptable. Our seniors deserve dignity and respect. We must find a solution. We need to fix this.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Mrs. Stubbs.\nMrs. Shannon Stubbs (Lakeland, CPC): Mr. Chair, Canada's oil and gas sector is in crisis, made worse by five years of bad policies, red tape and barriers to pipelines. Just in the last two months, we saw the largest production cut in Canadian history. Active rigs dropped by 92% and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs, adding to the 200,000 since 2015. Energy is Canada's biggest investor, and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions, not just words. On March 25, the finance minister promised help in hours or days, not weeks, but he's letting Canadians down. Sixty-three days later, small oil and gas companies still can't apply for BDC loans, and last week's large employer loan terms are predatory, with interest rates escalating to 14% by year five. Those are payday loan rates. The required stock options being at record lows could make the government the largest shareholder. That's not emergency assistance; it's pandemic profiteering. Programs can't help workers if businesses can't or won't actually get the support. The Liberals' death-by-delay tactics are doing exactly what foreign activists in other countries want: to shut down Canada's oil.\nThe Chair: Ms.Bessette, the floor is yours.\nMrs. Lyne Bessette (BromeMissisquoi, Lib.): Mr.Chair, in times of crisis, we stick together. I can state that this is certainly the case in BromeMissisquoi. In the last weeks, I have been calling volunteer action centres in my constituency so that they can tell me their news. I would like to take the time that I have to highlight the work that community organizations are doing tirelessly in my constituency. The crisis has made us realize the extent to which food banks and meals-on-wheels can not only relieve hunger, but also relieve thousands of shut-in seniors of their loneliness. Let me also highlight the devotion of the volunteers giving generously of their time, particularly the initiative of Mabel Hastings in the volunteer aid centre in Mansonville. Like me, she sends out a daily newsletter to keep the public informed about the many resources available for their support. COVID-19 is bringing out the best in our community and I am certain that, together, we will get through it.\nThe Chair: We will go to Mr. Virani.\nMr. Arif Virani (ParkdaleHigh Park, Lib.): Mr. Chair, during the COVID-19 pandemic I have been inspired by the courageous work of so many essential workers. I want to thank everyone on the front lines for keeping us safe, keeping us fed and keeping our communities functioning. I want to make special note of one particular essential health care worker, a woman who is a quarantine manager with the Public Health Agency of Canada. I have personally seen her working tirelessly over the past three months to keep all of us safe. That woman is my wife, Suchita Jain. Suchi, I love you, I am very proud of you and I thank you for all of the sacrifices you are making. I want to highlight another woman from my riding of ParkdaleHigh Park, Rachelle LeBlanc. She is a local designer. When the pandemic broke, she saw the need for protective barriers for small shops in Parkdale, so she set about collecting donations. She then put her design talents to work and started designing free-standing protective shields. Rachelle's team has now delivered 25 free COVID protective shields to small shopkeepers in Parkdale, and the team is on track to building 100 more. It's the compassion of Canadians like Rachelle that gives meaning to the phrase we are all in this together.\nThe Chair: Mr.Godin, you have the floor.\nMr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC): Mr.Chair, the school year has been shattered and our graduating classes must be proud of what they have achieved amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Young men, young women, be proud of your accomplishments! You can believe in the future. Keep learning. It will give you tools that will serve you all your lives. What you have achieved in this extraordinary year will set you apart from the others. I invite you to be inspired by that and turn it to your advantage. The current government has the obligation to promote the values that will lead you to become involved in your communities. Your willingness to learn or to work makes you into better citizens. Knowledge and experience are irreplaceable and invaluable. I implore this government, which is unaware of the damage it is causing, to immediately announce all the positions that have already been approved under the Canada summer jobs program. Urgent action is needed. Let us have confidence in our organizations, our companies, and let us support our youth, a rich resource that we must equip and motivate. I congratulate all the young graduates in the beautiful constituency of PortneufJacques-Cartier.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Mr. Fergus.\nMr. Greg Fergus (HullAylmer, Lib.): Mr.Chair, this pandemic lets us see what Canadians are made of. This coming Saturday, May30, more than 2,000Christians of all denominations are coming together virtually for prayer and for action. When the going gets tough, Canadians get going. This could not be more true than with respect to what will be happening on May 30. This Saturday, in more than 2,000 churches and homes, thousands of faith-filled Canadians are gathering to pray and act on those prayers as part of Stand United Canada. They will gather through television, Facebook Live and Instagram Live. Then they are going to deliver much-needed support to at-risk Canadians who live in disadvantaged areas. This is faith in action. I'm sure I speak for all parliamentarians when I wish success to Stand United Canada. I hope it inspires more Canadians to follow in its footsteps. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Ms. Harder.\nMs. Rachael Harder (Lethbridge, CPC): The best way to safeguard the truth is to allow people to speak freely, but from the very beginning of this pandemic, the Liberals have silenced dissent. Sadly, their short-sightedness has been to the detriment of Canadians. Early on, they propagated the notion that human-to-human transmission wasn't possible. They said that closing the borders wasn't necessary. They told us that wearing face masks wouldn't help. It is undeniable that the Liberal government has put Canadians in danger by silencing alternative points of view and has spread misinformation. Ironically, however, they have now gone ahead and crowned themselves the arbiters of truth. They are spending millions of dollars to censor what Canadians can and cannot say. They are determining what is true and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, what is in and what is out. When freedom of speech is repressed, it is safe to say that democracy is under siege. I call upon the government to restore the personal liberties that are granted under our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is Canada. We are not an autocracy; we are a democracy.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Mr. Nater.\nMr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC): Mr. Chair, small businesses have always been the cornerstone of communities across this country. They provide employment and economic stability and are always the first to support community functions and activities, but small businesses have been particularly hard hit due to COVID-19. They have shut their doors temporarily, and now many worry they'll never be able to open their doors again. With the season cancellations at the Stratford Festival, Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music, businesses in the tourism, hospitality, accommodation and retail sectors in PerthWellington are struggling. Every day, I talk to small business owners who can't access the Canada emergency business account, and others who find the convoluted commercial rent assistance program to be out of reach. The program is needlessly complicated, frustratingly slow and excessively restrictive. Mr. Chair, the government needs to go back, fix these programs and ensure that support goes to the small businesses that need it.\nThe Chair: We will now go to Ms. Collins.\nMs. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP): Mr. Chair, Canadians have been shaken by this pandemic. It has exposed the gaps in our health care system and our social safety net. It has shown how vulnerable we all are when disaster hits. It has brought us to a crossroads. We can go backwards to so-called business as usual, with horrific conditions in long-term care homes, widespread inequality and no real action on climate change, or we can build for better. In Victoria, people in the community, organizations and municipal leaders have been calling for a new way forward. The City of Victoria has a plan for reinvention, resilience and recovery. Organizations like Greater Victoria Acting Together; Common Vision, Common Action; and Kairos Victoria are exploring ideas for a sustainable and just recovery. We can build for better. We can invest in the infrastructure. We need to fight climate change, homelessness and inequality. We can build a Canada where we take better care of the planet and each other.\nThe Chair: We now move to Ms.DeBellefeuille.\nMrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ): Mr.Chair, in this time of pandemic, it is with heartfelt emotion that I want to highlight the excellent work of all the guardian angels at the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the entire staff, as well as the retirees who have come back to provide their assistance. I admire the managers, at all levels and in all services, working tirelessly so that their teams can answer the call in this difficult situation. My fellow managers and the management teams of the Support Program for the Autonomy of Seniors, both in home support and in residential care, you have my heartfelt congratulations for the herculean work you have done. My thoughts go particularly to Lyne Ricard and Vronique Proulx, managers working diligently with their teams of professionals to support the seniors living in intermediate resources, as we call them. I also warmly recognize the director of nursing services, Chantal Careau, who is facing the current challenge with passion and humanity. Once again, my congratulations go to the entire organization of the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest for their remarkable work in this difficult and very demanding time.\nThe Chair: We will go to Mr. Barlow.\nMr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC): During the worst of times, we see the best in people. Heroes are born, characters revealed, resiliency is sowed. I cannot say enough about my constituents in Foothillsfront-line health care workers, grocery store clerks, restaurateurs, farmersfor all they are doing to keep our community safe and healthy. I want to shine a light on some of our hidden heroes, such as Owen Plumb, a grade 9 student in Okotoks who is using his 3D printer to build PPE for front-line health care workers. He partnered with the Rotary Club and Evergreen Solutions in Okotoks to help with the manufacturing and assembly. There is also Sam Schofield, the volunteer president of the Pincher Creek Chamber of Commerce, overnight built a resiliency website for COVID-19 by building training tools for businesses throughout his area. He also helped develop the Foothills Business Recovery Taskforce, which is a resource for businesses throughout southern Alberta in my riding. Finally, to the employees of Cargill Foods in High River, I know this has been a very difficult time and that many of you have lost loved ones. I want to say thank you for tirelessly doing all you can to protect our food supply and keep food on our table. Each and every one of you is a hero. Thank you.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Chair: We will now go to Mr. Simms.\nMr. Scott Simms (Coast of BaysCentralNotre Dame, Lib.): Thank you, Chair. I would like to take this time to salute those who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide care and comfort to others. In my 16 years in the House of Commons I have never experienced anything like this, when we find our lives are at a standstill and there is so much sorrow felt by families who suffer from the effects of COVID-19. However, here are two examples of kindness right here in Newfoundland and Labrador. Shanna and Fred Patey of Bishop's Falls, along with a few of their friends, spend hours next to the Trans-Canada Highway with just a barbeque and a cooler. They serve free meals for truckers crossing our province each and every day. So far they have provided over 1,500 meals. There is also Mitch Strickland of Grand Falls-Windsor, who owns Appy's Diner. He has continually provided food for the local hospital and other front-line workers through his donations. To all our front-line workers in grocery stores and delivery trucks, and to doctors, nurses, LPNs, paramedics, first responders and, of course, our brave women and men in the military, we will be forever grateful and blessed because of you. Thank you.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Chair: That's all the time we have today for Statements by Members. Before going on, I just want to remind all the members that it is a one-minute statement, so if you don't mind, please time it before coming in because we do have limited time. The other thing that has come up is that some of you just naturally speak very quickly. I'm not here to judge anybody's way of speaking, but try to consider the translators and interpreters to make sure that everyone understands what is said, because they are working diligently to try to get both languages out. In sum, there are two things: please slow down and please make sure the statement is confined to one minute. We now move to Questions to Ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow the employees who are providing support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely.  Our first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. In the early days of the pandemic and the lockdown that followed, Canadians were told by this government that programs would be rolled out very quickly and that gaps and shortcomings would be changed as time went on. While many Canadians are being let down by this government's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs, Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago, yet here we are, two and a half months later, and many of these programs still have not been improved. I have a simple question for the Prime Minister. On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs. It's now May 27. Is the Prime Minister going to make that change?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Mr. Chair, we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly, and that's what we did. We rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly. Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19. We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses. What we've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country, but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it's a little more difficult for them to qualify. We are working with them through their regional development agencies, and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs, which will be able to help them get the money they deserve.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government. There's no excuse for the delay. It's May 27. They've known about these problems for weeks. They're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March, and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes. For example, companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened. The businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together. We have identified this gap. Again, it's a simple question. Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, I know that there are many different types of businesses across this country that need support. We have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can, and we continue to work on filling gaps. I know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding. I can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there's a way to make sure we're getting them the support they need.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's actually a very simple fix. I can save him and his officials a lot of time. The government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program. He can make this very clear, and save a lot of work, just by including the word acquisition. Will he do that?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, I can assure you that finance officials are working closely with Brandt Tractor. They're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that, for various reasons, are not able to apply for the help we have now. We will continue to work to make sure people who need the help get it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it's literally one word. We can email him the text. We can send him the page in the dictionary where that word is defined, if that would help. Another gap that is letting people down is in the rent relief program. The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70% revenue loss. There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50%, 55%, 60% or 65% loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent. We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open. Will the government introduce some flexibility to this program to help more businesses survive?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, our public servants and policy-makers have been moving creatively and quickly to try to get help to as many people as we possibly can, with our focus being on the people who need it the most. Obviously, this pandemic is affecting everyone and every business across the country in different ways, but our focus has been on ensuring that those who most need it are getting the help they can. We will, of course, continue to work with the parties opposite and all Canadians to ensure that we're getting help to everyone who needs it, but our focus has always been on the most vulnerable, first and foremost.\nThe Chair: The floor now goes to Mr.Blanchet.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question is for the Prime Minister. If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs, would it have laid off all its staff?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19. People work for those organizations, as accountants, receptionists, assistants or labourers, and those people need to be supported. We are supporting people all over the country through that program.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is the Liberal Party one of those organizations in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Any company or organization that can demonstrate a significant drop in its income, whether that be in donations, receipts, profits\nThe Chair: The floor goes to Mr.Blanchet.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we created specific criteria to help organizations in difficulty. Any organization experiencing those difficulties can apply.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: In the Magdalen Islands, fishing companies in difficulty and in need of assistance will not have the money that the Liberals are going to take. Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have invested in assistance for fishers all across the country. We recognize that it is a difficult situation because of COVID-19. We will be here for our fishers and for industries in difficulty.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: I am not catching many answers, it seems to me. A company in Drummondville that manufactures isolation membranes is in difficulty because a federal program is inadequate. Compared to that company, is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, there are clear criteria for submitting applications under these programs. Companies and organizations that receive money qualify for those programs.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: If the program criteria establish that the Liberal Party is an organization in difficulty, does that mean that the criteria to determine whether an organization is in difficulty are poorly designed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, all through this pandemic, our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs. This applies to all organizations and companies in the country to the extent possible. That is what we are in the process of doing.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Given the answers from the Prime Minister, let me ask this question: is the Prime Minister in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: No, Mr.Chair. We are doing important work for all Canadians, every day.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Restaurant owners on rue Ontario in Montreal feel that they will not make it through the crisis and that they will never open their doors again. They are in difficulty. By comparison, is the Liberal Party of Canada an organization in difficulty that will not open its doors again after the crisis? We can but hope.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established criteria for that program in order to help those working for various organizations. Any organization that receives the subsidy has qualified for it.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is there a consensus in the Liberal Party caucus that the Liberal Party is in difficulty as an organization?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are working every day to help Canadians and workers in difficulty. We are going to continue to do that work.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Does answering a question put the Prime Minister in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, it is a pleasure to be here in the House and to answer questions from Canadians and from members of the opposition.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: You are going to answer a question from a Quebecker, I hope. Companies are struggling in Saguenay, in the Gasp, in Beloeil. Would those companies not deserve to be saved by the money that the supposedly struggling Liberal Party has taken?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: I am always very happy to answer questions from all Canadians currently sitting in the House. We will be here to help workers in difficulty all across the country, including in Quebec.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: If the Prime Minister is so happy to answer questions, I hope he will be delirious with joy to answer this one. Is the Liberal Party in difficulty?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established a program to help those working in organizations and who could lose their jobs because of COVID-19. We are here to help workers in organizations and companies all over the country.\nThe Chair: We'll now go on to Mr. Singh.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling, but seniors need more than just compassionate words. They need action. Will the Prime Minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the Constitution of Canada is not an excuse. It lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities, and we respect the provinces' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities. However, from the very beginning, we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue. We need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for, which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: The former federal health minister, Dr. Philpott, said, We need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership. That is a former federal health minister. Now, we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost. Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in long-term care?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, over the past couple of days I've had very good conversations with the premiers of both Quebec and Ontario on this important issue. I look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well. This is something that Canadians have seen needs concerted action. We will be there to support the provinces.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Needles were reused and expired medication was used, according to military reports. Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in the care of our seniors?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the contents of that report were deeply disturbing and troubling for all Canadians. That is why we are committed to working with the provinces to fix this situation. Ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they've seen going on. We need to fix this, and we will do that together.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: The military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions. Going forward, we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: The military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, all Canadians know we need to do better by our seniors. This is something we all take very seriously, and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now, and going forward, we improve our systems. The federal government will be there to work with the provinces on making that happen.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister has said that he's willing to work with the provinces. I'm saying that we need to see federal leadership. We need a commitment at the federal level that the Prime Minister will push for things that people need, which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards. Will the Prime Minister go beyond working with provinces and show some leadership?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, I will always be here to stand up for Canadians in all different situations. We are going to work with the provinces, fully respecting jurisdictions, to make sure that, all across the country, Canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve.\nThe Chair: Mr. Singh, we have 30 seconds. Ask a brief question, please.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Thank you very much. The COVID-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee, in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice. This is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide, the same government that delayed the United Nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court. Will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas, including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence. We will continue to work with those partners, but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers, not on establishing the report. We will continue to work with them on the report, but the COVID-19 situation has made that more difficult.\nThe Chair: I want to thank the honourable members who are shouting time, but I do have a timer here, and I am taking care of it. I appreciate the help, but I do want to remind them that I have the proper machinery here. We will now go to Mr. Bezan.\nMr. James Bezan: Thank you, Chair. My question is to the Prime Minister. He was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario, and there was a report out from Quebec today. I want to commend the Canadian Armed Forces for witnessing these appalling conditions, putting it in the context of a report, and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities. The government is saying they didn't receive the report from the department until May 22, but this report came out on May 14. What happened to that report for eight days?\nThe Chair: We will go to the honourable minister. We seem to have a technical issue, Mr. Sajjan. We can't hear you. You might want to put down your bar and keep it down while you're speaking.\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence): Mr. Chair, I want to thank our Canadian Armed Forces members for the tremendous work they are doing. They did their duty, noted down their observations and reported them. While those observations were being reported directly to the managers, a report was being compiled. This report was given to me on the 21st. I then forwarded it to the Minister of Public Safety on the 22nd, and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards.\nMr. James Bezan: I trust that you got the report on the 21st, but the report was written on the 14th, so what happened with that report for seven days? Why wasn't it acted upon? Could you just explain that? Our loved ones were at risk during that entire time.\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, as we stated, this report was done and given up through the chain of command, and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence. Once we received this report, it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities. Again, I want to commend our Canadian Armed Forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty.\nMr. James Bezan: That report from Ontario documented appalling conditions, horrific care that was being given to the clients, and also the way that the staff conducted themselves. We know that there are 39 members of the Canadian Armed Forces currently infected with COVID-19. Minister, do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, when it comes to any type of activities that we send our Canadian Armed Forces on, we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training. This is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment. We have the right protocols in place, and we will make sure that our members who are infected by COVID will get the appropriate treatment as well.\nMr. James Bezan: Does the Minister of National Defence believe that our soldiers serving in Operation Laser, who have put themselves in harm's way in battling the COVID virus as a war, deserve to have hazard pay benefits?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, when it comes to looking after Canadian Armed Forces personnel, yes, we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay. This is currently being drafted, and we will have more to say on this shortly.\nMr. James Bezan: I hope that means it's a yes. I do encourage the government to provide that compensation to our soldiers and troops serving in Operation Laser. I would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from May 14 to May 21, when that report was in the department for one week. Under our parliamentary system, ministers are accountable for the conduct of their departments. Will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear: When it comes to the observations that were made, those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province. At the same time, this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command, and they did their due diligence. As I stated, it was given to us, and on the same day it was forwarded to the Minister of Public Safety, who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities.\nMr. James Bezan: Was one of those authorities that this was sent to the RCMP?\nHon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, as stated, this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC): Thank you, Chair. Yesterday it was revealed that the Minister of Digital Government has been promoting a fundraising campaign to sue Global News for their story criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Why is the minister using her authority to support the Communist Party of China and threatening our media and freedom of expression?\nHon. Joyce Murray (Minister of Digital Government): Mr. Chair, we value the important work of media right across the country. Attacking the integrity of hard-working journalists is simply not acceptable. Like many members on all sides of the House.... WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with\nThe Chair: Now we'll go back to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is the minister aware of the efforts that the United Front carries out on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to influence how Canadians view the People's Republic of China?\nHon. Joyce Murray: Thank you for that question. Mr. Chair, I want to just be clear. The participation in the WeChat group, much like Facebook, is guided by posted\nThe Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is the minister an active participant in the efforts by the Communists to muzzle a Canadian journalist and deprive Canadians of the facts about China?\nHon. Joyce Murray: Muzzling journalists is never acceptable, and our government is very clear on that. I will say that the individual in question posted something outside of the guidelines of my WeChat group and is no longer\nThe Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk, I just want to point out that we do have interpreters listening and trying to interpret. They'd appreciate it....\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: My questions are short. That's probably what it is.\nThe Chair: Take a deep breath.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, the Liberals can't shrug this off. The minister admitted to theBreaker that her own political staff manages this WeChat. This is someone who is paid by Canadian taxpayers. Why is the minister using tax dollars to help China attack Global News and freedom of expression?\nHon. Joyce Murray: I think the member knows very well that the people who post on WeChat are free to post what they choose within certain guidelines. Those guidelines were ignored. That person is no longer part of my WeChat group. The post was completely unacceptable, and I do not share the views of the individual.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, Sam Cooper is an investigative Canadian journalist who has uncovered many different criminal rackets that can be linked back to Beijing. Has the minister apologized to Sam Cooper for attempting to shut down his work?\nHon. Joyce Murray: As we all know, community outreach is a very important part of the work of a member of Parliament. WeChat is one of many social media sites regularly used by members\nThe Chair: We go back to Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, when will the minister apologize to Sam Cooper and Global News?\nHon. Joyce Murray: Mr. Chair, I have been very clear that I do not share the views of the person who posted on my WeChat site, who operated outside of my\nThe Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, in December 2018 the Liberals passed Bill C-76. This included provisions to prevent foreign interference in Canadian society. Does the government believe that Joyce Murray's actions have violated this portion of the act?\nHon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, I want to assure the member that we are always vigilant in any foreign interference in our national security or issues of political interference in our society. It's monitored carefully by the national security establishment, according to the law as it exists in this country, and we will remain vigilant.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, in May 2019, the Liberals launched their digital charter. One of the principles was strong democracy, a commitment to defend freedom of expression. Will the Liberals hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated this part of the charter?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, we are absolutely committed to the rule of law and will always uphold it. I think, as the minister has made very clear, she was not involved in this process and has no control over the individual who posted that matter.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, unfortunately I don't believe that was a sufficient answer. This is really a yes or no. Will the government hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated their part of the charter?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, Mr. Chair, I want to assure the member that our government remains committed to the rule of law and we will always work tirelessly to uphold the laws of this country.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is that a yes or a no?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, I think it was very clear. We will always uphold the laws of Canada.\nMrs. Rosemarie Falk: Still, was that a yes or a no? I'm not hearing a yes or a no.\nHon. Bill Blair: I am doing my very best, Mr. Chair, to answer the question for the House and to assure the member opposite that our government will always remain committed to the rule of law. That is unequivocal.\nThe Chair: We will now move on to the honourable member. The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell.\nMr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am very happy and proud to be participating in this discussion in the House of Commons today. My question is very simple: how much is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr.Chair, we continue to be transparent with our measures. Of course, we want to make sure that our investments, our economy\nThe Chair: The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Let me ask my question to the honourable Minister of Finance once more, since he is talking about transparency. My question is really simple: how much is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, our economic situation is very fluid. We have made major investments and we are making sure that our economy is working.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, the minister's answer is not fluid at all. But the question is really simple: how much is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, it is important to be transparent with our investments. We look at the investments and the figures every day.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, the Minister of Finance may not know what the deficit is, but one great Canadian does know. And he knows that he knows. Could the Minister of Finance be very clear, very fluid and, above all, very transparent with Canadians? What is Canada's deficit?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I want to be very clear with Canadians: our economic situation is very difficult. The situation is fluid. We are making investments to ensure that our economy will be strong in the future.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, with all due respect to the Minister of Finance, let me point out that, though he is not very clear, Canada's Parliamentary Budget Officer was clear yesterday. The deficit is $260billion. That is the real number. Why does the government not have the courage to state it clearly, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer did yesterday?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we always want to be clear and transparent. It is very important for the situation to be stable in order to ensure our future. That is our economic approach. We are making investments now so that the situation becomes more stable.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, I know that the Minister of Finance is very good with figures. But he is not able to give us one. Perhaps he could comment on the statement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer made yesterday, that the emergency assistance must have an end date, and if it does not, we are heading to levels of taxation that have not been seen in this country for generations. What is the government going to do to make sure that Canadians will not be overtaxed after this crisis?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to make investments. That way, we will have a resilient economy in the future. That's very important. That way, we know that we'll have a good economy in the future. When we have more information, we will\nThe Chair: Mr.Deltell, you have the floor.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, will the minister commit not to raise taxes after the crisis?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I have said several times that we do not have a plan to raise taxes. That's very important.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Finally a clear answer! However, I'm not convinced that he will apply it. In fact, the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself has said that there isn't much ammunition left without shifting into a large structural deficit, which can lead directly to tax increases. If the Minister of Finance can't even say today what the deficit is today, how can he be credible when he says that he won't raise taxes?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I think what's most important is that during this pandemic, Canadians and companies across the country need the Government of Canada's help. That is our approach. That way, we will have an economy that will function in the future. Of course, this is important for future generations.\nMr. Grard Deltell: When will there be an economic update?\nHon. Bill Morneau: \nMr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, all observers are expecting an economic update to know where we're going. When will that happen?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we want our economic update to be accurate. That's why we are looking at information that allow us to make good forecasts.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC): Mr. Chair, the United States, Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam have created an economic prosperity group to diversify some of their key supply chains away from China. Canada has a free trade agreement with six of these seven countries. Why are we not part of this group?\nHon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade): Mr. Chair, I thank the hon. member for that question. Indeed, we have been working diligently with all of these countries to make sure that we are keeping global supply chains open during this critical time. I think everyone agrees that keeping supply chains open for medical goods, critical agriculture and essential goods is absolutely essential and\nThe Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, this government is refusing to come to terms with what COVID-19 will mean for the future of international trade. Why is Canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same?\nThe Chair: Before we go to the minister, one of the members has his mike still on, and I would ask that he turn it off. I am hearing background noise. The hon. minister.\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, Canada has unprecedented access to a number of markets around the world because of the extraordinary agreements that we have made to provide access to customers in those international markets. During COVID-19, we have been working with our G20 partners. I have had two meetings with G20 trade ministers on the importance of keeping supply chains\nThe Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, is this payback for the Prime Minister snubbing these countries at the original TPP signing?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we have a CPTPP arrangement with these countries, and we are looking forward to making sure that we get Canadian businesses growing into those markets.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the U.K. will begin applying tariffs at the beginning of next year on Canadian exports such as seafood, beef and cars. These are the items that have had tariffs removed under CETA. Will the government commit to having a new trade agreement with the U.K. in place by January 1?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we are monitoring the situation very carefully. The U.K., of course, is a very important trading partner for Canada. They are in discussions right now. I want to assure Canadian businesses that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the U.K. during this period while they go through Brexit.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, after CUSMA, this government guaranteed to the trade committee that they would publish the objectives of any new trade agreement. When will we see these objectives published and actually have a chance to view them?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we look forward to working to ensure that those objectives are published as we get into future trade discussions.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the resignation of the WTO director-general at this unprecedented time is concerning for the international trade community. Is the government committed to supporting a DG candidate who is dedicated to the massive reforms needed to get the WTO functioning again?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the hon. member for that good question. The Ottawa group, led by Canada, is working with like-minded countries on the reform of the WTO. We've been doing this work and we continue to do this work. I look forward to making sure that we are leading the way on those discussions with like-minded\nThe Chair: Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, last week the President of the United States considered blocking cattle imports. Our beef producers don't need this. They need stability. Three-quarters of Canada's beef cattle exports go to the U.S. Has the government sought out and received assurances from the United States that no such action will apply to Canadian cattle?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs): Mr. Chair, we have an excellent assurance of our trade with the United States, which is our new NAFTA trade agreement that we have negotiated, thanks to the unprecedented co-operation across this country. It is very important to the Canadian economy and Canadian producers.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, going forward post-COVID, there are a lot things that will be changing in supply chains. What is this government doing proactively to look at opportunities in these supply chains that Canadian businesses can take advantage of?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we continue to work with countries around the globe to ensure that Canada's supply chains and those global supply chains, particularly for essential goods, for agricultural products, for medical supplies, continue to remain open. We will keep doing this work.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, on the agriculture side, canola farmers would like to know the status of canola going into China. Can she update the House on that status?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food): Mr.Chair, I want to assure my colleague that we are continuing to work with our industry representatives, our allies and our trading partners in China.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Ms. McLeod.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod (KamloopsThompsonCariboo, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senior Canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early January that China was procuring and hoarding PPE. As a member of cabinet, was the health minister aware?\nHon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Mr. Chair, from the very beginning of the outbreak in early January we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face, and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: In April, the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile. Can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of PPE for China on January 31, claiming it would not compromise our supply? She can't have it both ways. We don't have enough; we have enough and it won't compromise it.\nHon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Mr. Chair, we are operating in a highly competitive global environment, and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time, which we have been doing in the past weeks and months, to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep Canadians safe. That's our priority. That's what we're working on.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Unfortunately, this question was directed to the health minister, referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies. Before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, provinces and territories have their own stockpiles, which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions. We've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support. In fact, of all the requests made so far, we have been able to complete them.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to N95 masks. Did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that PPE she shipped out, providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, the equipment that was donated when China was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus. As the member opposite knows, we've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Mr. Chair, I would suggest that during February and March our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently, but I want to move on to another topic. When defending the sale of 22 seniors' homes to the Chinese government, the Prime Minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards. He said that this regime ensures the care our seniors get is top quality. That was in 2017. Now he states he is saddened, shocked, disappointed and angered. Was the Prime Minister completely oblivious to the risks, or was he just too anxious to please the Chinese government when he sold those 22 homes?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of B.C., and I have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes. The member opposite is trying to confuse the issue. As she knows, the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: The Prime Minister does not have authority over seniors' homes, which he has clearly stated, but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale. At 18 months, government had an obligation to make sure there was compliance. Was that done?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act, and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act.\nMrs. Cathy McLeod: Under the Investment Canada Act, the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance. Four homes had to close. Since the government approved the sale, it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country\nHon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear that we understand how difficult this is for seniors. That is why we follow the appropriate steps, outlined under the Investment Canada Act, to make sure that any measures we take keep seniors and their well-being first and foremost.\nThe Chair: Mr.Therrien, you now have the floor.\nMr. Alain Therrien (La Prairie, BQ): Mr.Chair, during the pandemic, the government has given money to companies that don't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens. We told the government that it didn't make sense. The government's response was that it is no big deal. During the pandemic, the government gave money to Air Canada, but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for. We told the government that it did not make sense. The government's response was that it was no big deal. During the pandemic, the Liberal Party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities. We told them that it did not make sense. The government responded that it was no big deal. Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal?\nHon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue): Mr.Chair, the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government. We will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes. Let me be clear: in everything we do, we will target companies and not innocent workers. Employees are employees, no matter who they work for.\nMr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, when I see that it's the Minister of National Revenue answering me, I don't feel like buying a lottery ticket. The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign, which seems to indicate that it isn't short of money. However, the Liberals used the emergency wage subsidy. Why? Is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that's experiencing a significant drop in income. That's the approach we've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future. We will continue this approach.\nMr. Alain Therrien: It's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election, yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $7million since the last election. Is the party in jeopardy? Can it go bankrupt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, as I said, our approach is to protect employees. We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future.\nMr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, we still don't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar. We think they may have taken as much as $1million. How many SMEs could have been saved with the $1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we appreciate the question. We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy, the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs. We will continue this approach to help SMEs and their employees.\nMr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, I will propose a choice of answers, or I won't get any. When did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy? Now here are three possible answers. The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy, they set parameters allowing them to use it. The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are, but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy, they thought they could do it too. The third possible answer is that the Liberals hadn't planned to use the subsidy, but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it, because that's what they do.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada. That's our approach, and I believe it's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic.\nThe Chair: We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): We will now resume the discussion.  We'll continue with Ms. Khalid, the honourable member for MississaugaErin Mills.\nMs. Iqra Khalid (MississaugaErin Mills, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be splitting my time with the member for PickeringUxbridge. Mr. Chair, when the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in Ontario at the request of the premier, they released a report that outlined their findings in detail. Military members witnessed residents' cries for help going unanswered. They saw force-feeding. They saw bug infestations, a lack of personal protective equipment and neglect. Canadians are shaken. They are appalled by the horrific conditions outlined in the military report. Almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in Ontario alone, over 25 of them in my riding of MississaugaErin Mills. These deaths could have been prevented. Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, it's such an important question. I believe all Canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the Canadian Armed Forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in Ontario. What's happening to seniors in Ontario is completely unacceptable. The report is very troubling. Seniors deserve to live with dignity, with respect and with safety. While long-term care is provincially regulated, we know that we need to work together. The Government of Canada stands ready to support provinces and territories as they continue to respond to this crisis. I had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work. We also know that seniors want to stay at home longer. That's why our historic investment of $6 billion in home care was so important. We'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now to Ms. O'Connell.\nMs. Jennifer O'Connell (PickeringUxbridge, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will sadly report that my community of Pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single COVID-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country. Seventy residents at Orchard Villa long-term care home died during this pandemic. It was a devastating blow to our community. Yesterday, we received the horrific report from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing what they witnessed at Orchard Villa in Pickering, Altamont Care Community in Scarborough, Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke, Hawthorne Place in North York, and Holland Christian Homes' Grace Manor in Brampton. The loved ones of those who have passed away, as well as the homes' workers, have asked for a full public inquiry from the Ontario government. I know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction, but on behalf of our communities, can the Minister of Health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the Ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full, independent, non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that won't even start until September?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I would say that all Canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes. We're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals. We also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care. We have to do better as a country. These are our loved ones. These are our parents and our grandparents. These are the people in our lives who have given so much to us. I stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society. We know that there's a role we can play at the federal level with advice, with guidance, with support and, yes, with investments. We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now to Mr. Davies from Vancouver Kingsway.\nMr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canadians were horrified to hear the report yesterday from our armed forces about the appalling conditions experienced by seniors in our long-term care homes. Page after page detailed the filth, neglect, abuse and danger our seniors in care are exposed to on a daily basis. Shockingly they face injury and death through missed medications, expired medications, unsterile devices and violations of basic contagion rules to stop the spread of COVID-19. Given that evidence of possible criminal conduct was contained in the military's report, will the minister refer this matter to the RCMP for investigation immediately?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, thanks very much to the member for those expressions of concern, which we share. We understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges, and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable. Considering the severity of this report, we promptly shared it with the Province of Ontario, and the Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report's findings. Their investigation includes alerting the province's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction. We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities, and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross.\nMr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, that's a shocking answer considering there's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this. That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation's RCMP is unacceptable. The seniors care crisis is a national problem. COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada's entire network of long-term care facilities. Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day. As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries, with over 80% of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities. Will this government move swiftly to establish binding national standards for long-term care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes. He's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time, that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors. As the member knows, we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home. We know that is one part of the solution, but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care. That's the work I'm doing now. I'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all.\nMr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, what we need is binding national standards, just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally. Gross fecal contamination, filthy medical equipment, insect infestations, ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada's hospitals. There's no reason to accept them in Canada's long-term care facilities. Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act, or similar legislation, with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors, just like we do for hospitals?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country, not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes, regardless of the province in which they live. We know we need to do better. We know that collectively, at all levels of government, we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years. The member has my commitment that I will work with provinces and territories to find a solution forward to ensure that every person has the right to age with dignity and safety.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Davies, you have 15 seconds for another question, a short one, and leave time for a response.\nMr. Don Davies: Thank you, Mr. Chair. These failures are the product of systemic neglect often motivated by prioritizing profit over the provision of adequate care. Does the minister agree that we should not be putting profits above the health care needs of Canada's seniors?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I believe that, when we commit to taking care of people, we must do so with the utmost care that is required. I know that provinces and territories have a lot of work to do. So do we, at the federal level, and obviously at the local level. We must all work together to protect those people in our lives who are most vulnerable, whether they be seniors, children or others.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now move on to Mr. Schmale, HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock. Mr. Schmale, go ahead.\nMr. Jamie Schmale (HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock, CPC): Thank you, Chair. According to Vaughn Palmer in an editorial in the Vancouver Sun regarding the secret Wet'suwet'en deal, Palmer writes:     The hereditary chiefs calculated the two governments would sign despite the objections from the elected chiefs. They likewise got the terms they wanted in the MOU while giving up absolutely nothing. Just as they figured governments would keep the contents secret from the public.   Can the minister describe another situation in which the federal government negotiated a secret deal of this magnitude with unelected people?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett (Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations): I thank the member for his ongoing concern and I want to remind him that actually it is in keeping with the Supreme Court decision of 1997 that we were to now begin those conversations with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who took the case to the Supreme Court. As we've said many times, this is not an agreement; this is an MOU that establishes the path forward for the substantive discussions towards a final agreement, which would describe the future governance and the implementation of Wet'suwet'en rights and title. It is about a shared commitment.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, if it is a shared commitment, why on the eve of the signing ceremony did the four elected chiefs denounce the hereditary chiefs for keeping them in the dark?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, it's really important that the member understand that there was a process for the hereditary chiefs to go back to their communities and discuss with them. Any agreement after the good work that will happen now would have to go back and seek the approval of all of the communities.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, the Burns Lake Band members are openly wondering if they're still a band or if the few unelected hereditary chiefs will control everything now. Minister, can you assure them that going forward you will honour their concerns and take the time to listen?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I ask honourable members to still direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Actually, the honourable member knows that the next steps include the further and ongoing engagement by the Wet'suwet'en in their house groups and that will include the six elected chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en nation, their community members and many others. This is about going forward and making sure that any\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. Cynthia Joseph, a chief councillor with the Hagwilget First Nation says the MOU between Ottawa, the province and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs was only shared with her community members on May 9, two days after it was published in the media. Is this part of the open and transparent government all Canadians can expect of the Prime Minister?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Walking the path of reconciliation means that we work with our partners and there is a way that they do the work within their communities. It is going to be an agreement to begin the work, but any final agreement is going to have to be approved by all members of the nation in terms of developing a consensus for the agreement\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. Does the minister have any concerns regarding claims by several former female hereditary chiefs that they were stripped of their hereditary status because they didn't agree with the men?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, it is going to be really important that the work take place within the Wet'suwet'en nation to determine their future governance, to determine their way of working with Canada and to make sure\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.\nMr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. For some reason it seems to be a problem to stand up for these hereditary female chiefs who had their titles taken away. Does the minister plan on recognizing band council resolutions denying the authority of hereditary chiefs to sign any future agreements without consent of the elected chiefs and the 3,000 members within the Wet'suwet'en they represent?\nHon. Carolyn Bennett: I think the member must understand that, as we begin the work, the nation will do its work and then we will come to the table to determine what the governance would be. Will it be a hybrid model like at Heiltsuk, like Ktunaxa, like some of the communities developing their constitutions, developing their laws and deciding how they will determine their own governance and that partnership with Canada?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus (CharlesbourgHaute-Saint-Charles, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. The current restrictions on non-essential travel at the border do not prevent people from claiming refugee protection if they have family in Canada. Why is the minister refusing to allow married people to cross the border?\nHon. Bill Blair: I want to thank the honourable member for a very important question. We have heard from many constituents and members of Parliament from right across the country who are expressing concern about non-status spouses being denied entry into the country because their travel is deemed to be non-essential. I've recently been in touch with all of the provinces and territories because I think it's very important that we have their support for any changes\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have the floor.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: If I understand correctly, Mr.Minister, you are talking to provincial representatives, but a case like that of ChantalTremblay, for instance, is unacceptable. For two months now, she has been trying to bring her spouse to Canada, but it isn't working. Is there a way to issue a directive to border services officers that married spousesit's often marriages with Americanscan cross the border to join their spouses in Canada?\nHon. Bill Blair: Just to be very clearagain, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify thisit is never our intention to separate families, but at the same time, we have imposed appropriate and necessary restrictions on non-essential travel. Our border services officers inquire of everyone coming to that border about the nature of their travel, and for non-citizens who come to that border seeking entry into Canada, if their entry is deemed non-essential, then they exercise their discretion not to allow\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have the floor.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: Thank you, Mr.Chair. Information from the Canada Border Services Agency has just come out. Since March21, 425,000people have flown into Canada. Among them were 295,000Canadians, which isn't a problem. However, 100,000foreigners have entered Canada, even though the border is supposedly closed. How does the minister explain the fact that 100,000people arrived in Canada by plane?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify. We have imposed very significant restrictions on non-essential travel, but of course there are circumstances where individuals come to this country and their entry into Canada is deemed essential. For example, someone who is providing medical services and coming into Canada to provide those services would be deemed essential, because there is a great need among Canadians for those services. It's dealt with on a case-by-case basis. As you can see by the numbers, we have had a very significant reduction in the travel of all non-Canadians to Canada over the past two months.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: So the minister confirms that the 100,000people who arrived by air were providing a service considered essential to Canada. I'm not talking about the people who crossed the land border, but the people who came to Canada by air.\nHon. Bill Blair: What I can tell you is that at all points of entry, including our air borders, we apply the standard that the travel must be deemed essential, and that determination is utilized to see if a person is eligible to enter into the country.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: We're now learning that the Correctional Service of Canada's investigation into the murder of MarylneLevesque is suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Canadians aren't fooled; they know full well that it is a political decision. All the technological means are available to allow the investigation to continue. I'm proof of that today. Can the minister direct the Correctional Service of Canada to resume the investigation into the death of MarylneLevesque?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, I thank the member for the question, because we know the concern of the people of Quebec, and the family of Ms. Levesque needs answers and deserves answers. That's why we asked the Parole Board and the Correctional Service of Canada to convene a board of investigation. Clearly, during COVID transmission, the ability to conduct that investigation and to interview all of the witnesses became extremely difficult and has been temporarily suspended, but at the very earliest opportunity we remain resolute to resume that investigation and get to the bottom of it to provide the answers that the family deserves.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have only 20seconds remaining.\nMr. Pierre Paul-Hus: Mr.Chair, victims of crime are one of the segments of the population most affected by the crisis. As we know, the government refuses to allow victims of crime to participate in parole hearings. For the first time in its history, and to add insult to injury, the government has cancelled all activities related to Victims and Survivors of Crime Week, which was to take place next week. Why is the Prime Minister turning his back on victims?\nHon. Bill Blair: Again, at the earliest days of COVID, until arrangements could be put in place, there were restrictions on victims participating. We have put the systems in place to allow victims to present their evidence virtually, either by video or by phone, to ensure that their voices are heard in these important things. We very much respect and support the role of victims in these determinations, and we're making every effort to ensure that they can participate.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now to Mr. Cumming, Edmonton Centre.\nMr. James Cumming (Edmonton Centre, CPC): Mr. Chair, yesterday I asked the Minister of Small Business how many business credit availability guarantees were issued by EDC, and I didn't get a number. Does she have an exact, finite, number of the guarantees today?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, thank you to the honourable member for that question. Our government has taken swift and immediate action to support Canadian businesses through this time. Money from this program is flowing, and businesses across the country are receiving the important support that they need.\nMr. James Cumming: How many BCAP applications have been received so far?\nHon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, these are large loans, and they require important due diligence and adjudication by the financial institutions. We will continue to be open and transparent as the accurate information becomes available.\nMr. James Cumming: How long does it take to be approved for a BCAP guarantee?\nHon. Mary Ng: I want to assure the member that we're going to do everything possible to support businesses and workers during this very important time.\nMr. James Cumming: How many businesses have received funding under the BCAP co-lending program since March?\nHon. Mary Ng: The lending programs, particularly the program to help small businesses, have really helped lots of businesses. Over 630,000 loans have been issued, and this is really helping those\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: Unfortunately, lots is not an answer for the businesses that I'm trying to talk to. Can you tell me, for the CEBA changes that were recently announced, when will we be able to see people who have income through a dividend able to apply?\nHon. Mary Ng: That's a very important question, Mr. Chair. There's nothing more important to me and to our government than getting these supports out to businesses. Those small businesses that will meet the expanded CEBA criteria are working very diligently with the financial institutions to make sure that they can get access to those loans as quickly as possible.\nMr. James Cumming: Can the minister give me a day when that will happen?\nHon. Mary Ng: The financial institutions are working very hard to make sure that they can make this available to businesses.\nMr. James Cumming: When will a sole proprietor be able to go for those loans?\nHon. Mary Ng: We will work very hard and very diligently to make sure that these businesses and those sole proprietors are supported.\nMr. James Cumming: Could they go on Monday?\nHon. Mary Ng: There is nothing more important than making sure these businesses weather the difficult time of COVID-19, and our measures are\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: How about Tuesday?\nHon. Mary Ng: I think we will all agree that getting support to these businesses is absolutely crucial. Our commitment is always going to be to get support to these businesses.\nMr. James Cumming: I can't get a distinct answer on any of those questions. Can you tell me how much headroom is left on the CEBA program?\nHon. Mary Ng: Today, over 630,000 businesses have received the support to do things like pay for salaries, the 25% top-up for the wage subsidy, pay for rent and pay for insurance and utilities. This is what these loans are helping our small\nMr. James Cumming: How many dollars are left in the program so businesses can have some certainty that the program will be available for some time?\nHon. Mary Ng: I think you will see that the businesses across the country that I have talked to really appreciate that the government has stepped up to help them during this difficult time. These include women with businesses, indigenous-owned businesses and those small businesses all across our communities, all across the country, that are getting the necessary help. We are going to keep\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: How many dollars? It can't be that complicated. How many dollars?\nHon. Mary Ng: There are 630,000 businesses that are getting help, and thousands more businesses will be getting help with the expanded criteria. We're going to keep doing the work that we need to help our businesses across this country through this difficult time.\nMr. James Cumming: I heard from a constituent in my riding that they waited for over four hours on the portal for CECRA. Is there an issue with the portal, and if so, when will it be fixed?\nHon. Mary Ng: Making sure that businesses get the help for commercial rent support is absolutely crucial right now. We are going to endeavour to make sure that this help gets out to those small businesses. Applications have opened in a staggered way and\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one last short question, Mr. Cumming.\nMr. James Cumming: Finally, the Prime Minister yesterday said that a list of all organizations that have been receiving CEWS will be made public. When will that be done?\nHon. Mary Ng: We have committed to making sure that those companies taking the wage subsidy program will be listed publicly. We have committed to doing that and we will do so.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We now go to Mr. d'Entremont from West Nova. Mr. d'Entremont, go ahead.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have a question for the Minister of Fisheries, but I thought I would say this first. The Canadian Coast Guard is doing a search at this moment following the loss of a vessel off the coast of Newfoundland. From my community, which is a seafaring, fishing community, I just want to put my thoughts out there to the folks of Newfoundland. We are definitely thinking of them during this difficult time. My first question revolves around the lobster fishery. It's been open in Cape Breton since May 15, I believe. The weather has been good. The harvesters have been going at it every day. The price has dropped to $4.25 already. Unstable markets will probably cause it to drop even more. What is the minister doing to make sure the lobster industry survives?\nHon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank my colleague for his comments with regard to the tragic accident off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, where we saw the loss of life in a fishing accident. Of course, as coastal people, we are all in solidarity with the people of Newfoundland right now. We know that the fish and seafood sector has taken extreme hits because of COVID-19. We're working diligently to make sure we support the industry as best we can. We have made available over half a billion dollars to processors and harvesters to make sure they can weather this storm. We have made sure that the harvesters are able to access the harvester benefit as well as the grant, recognizing the unique nature of their business and how they are not able to access some of our other programs. We are continuing to monitor what is happening in the industry. We will continue to make sure we do everything we can to support the fish and seafood sector.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, to continue along this vein for a moment, we are still looking at unstable markets for a longer period of time. At this point, processors are being selective in what they're buying. They're not buying culls and other kinds of lobsters. The plants are filling up, and harvesters are worried that they might stop buying product before the season is complete. What can the fishermen expect, or what kinds of programs can they expect, if the season goes bust?\nHon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, we know that this is a very challenging season for our harvesters. We also know that because of the decline in markets, we've had to make accommodations for the processing sector in order to help them be better able to support the harvesters. We have put in $62.5 million, which is allowing the processors to increase capacity in their refrigeration and freezers so that they will continue to be able to purchase product. As I said earlier, we will continue to monitor the situation and make sure we do everything possible to support our harvesters. This is a very difficult\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. d'Entremont.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, I don't know whether this next question will go to the Minister of DFO or the Minister of Transport. Oakley Ryerson is a resident of West Nova. He is planning a career on the sea and wants to get his master class four. The problem is that he can't pass the eye exam. He needs full-colour vision. For those who are far-sighted or nearsighted, you just have to put on your glasses to correct it. You can actually fly airplanes. I don't know about space shuttles, but who knows? You can now wear colour-corrected lenses, but Transport Canada still does not recognize these for use. Can the Minister of Transport help Ryerson in attaining his chosen profession?\nHon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport): Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concern of my colleague for one of the residents in his riding. I would ask him to write to me and lay out the situation. We have medical standards with respect to a number of different kinds of transportation-related jobs for pilots, mariners and those kinds of occupations, which have to be respected. However, if he sends me the details, I will look into it personally.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. d'Entremont, you have another 20 to 25 seconds left.\nMr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the eligibility criteria for financial support include the need to demonstrate a significant loss of income during the months of March and April, yet several SMEs in the tourism industry can't qualify because their operations start with the tourist season, in late May or early June. What will the government do to help them?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, before accessing the emergency wage subsidy, applicants must meet important criteria. However, as we explained last week, we will be adjusting the wage subsidy until the end of August, and we will be reviewing the criteria.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We're going to go to the west coast and the member for SaanichGulf Islands. Ms. May, go ahead.\nMs. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. My question is with regard to the urgent problem of mental health crises across Canada. My colleague, Jenica Atwin from Fredericton, held a press conference this morning in which she used the term echo pandemic. We will face an echo pandemic. We're already seeing increases in suicides on southern Vancouver Island. My question to the minister is this: Will we see direct funding to community mental health services as urgently requested by the Canadian Mental Health Association?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I read the honourable member's colleague's letter just today, and I want to reassure all members that we have invested in mental health supports for Canadians, obviously before the pandemic hit but certainly since we've been living with the pandemic. I'd like to remind all members to direct their constituents to the wellnesstogether.ca website and portal. There Canadians can find online resources, as well as connections to real and alive counsellors and other professionals who can help them with their various concerns.\nMs. Elizabeth May: This question relates to another current emergency: the climate emergency. This week it was reported that the concentration of greenhouse gases reached 417 parts per million. That's not just unprecedented over thousands of years; that's unprecedented over the last one million years. The temperatures in the Arctic broke 86F, 30C in the Arctic circle. The recognized parties in the House have established standing committees to work, but not the committee on the environment. We've asked for this in negotiations. When will the recognized parties remember the June 2019 emergency resolution that we are in a climate emergency, and start making sure that we hit 2020 commitments under the Paris Agreement to improve our targets?\nHon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's questions. I will remind her that we have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. We've also committed to surpassing the targets that we had originally set for 2030. We realize that along with the COVID pandemic, which is the major problem that exists in the world today, there is another problem as well that affects the entire planet, and that is the problem associated with climate change. We remain committed to achieving those targets.\nMs. Elizabeth May: My next question will be for Minister Blair, but as an aside, I will say that last answer completely fails to meet the legal requirements of the Paris Agreement to file a new target this year. To save some time, Minister Blair, let's pretend to go back to the questions from my colleague MP Paul-Hus and to your last answer. This is dealt with on a case-by-case basis by CBSA agents. There are thousands of them. They are exercising personal, subjective judgment. This is not acceptable. I'm begging the minister. Could the minister please put out a directive, advice to every CBSA agent on the ground, that when a non-status entry point sees a non-status direct relativehusband, wife, child of a Canadian citizenthat relative be deemed to be entering Canada for an essential purpose?\nHon. Bill Blair: I'd like to thank the member for bringing this issue forward again. It's an important one. We have been working very hard to ensure that we do everything possible to keep families together. At the same time, we've been working with the provinces and territories, listening to the concerns of Canadians about ensuring that travel across our international border, particularly with the United States, is limited to essential travel. As I've indicated, I've had a number of important conversations and necessary conversations with our provincial and territorial partners. I believe there is a consensus on the right way forward on this, and we're working very diligently to put it in place. I want to assure the member opposite that we have given very clear direction to our CBSA officers. I believe our border services officers have been doing an extraordinary job for us in the exercise of their discretion. At the same time, they have been doing the important work of ensuring the health and safety of Canadians at our border.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We're now going to Ms. Kwan for Vancouver East. Ms. Kwan, go ahead.\nMs. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP): Four out of the five homes listed in the armed forces report were for-profit. It is painfully clear that corporate profits are being put ahead of the well-being of seniors. Will the minister admit that the for-profit model is failing our loved ones and commit to getting profits out of long-term care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: As the member opposite notes, nobody can read that report or hear those stories without feeling absolute horror and disgust and without demanding better for the elders in our lives. As I have mentioned many times in the House, our government remains committed to working with provinces and territories to ensure that every elder person in our community can age with dignity and in safety.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: Minister, if that's the case, I will ask again. Will the minister make sure that the focus of long-term care homes is taking care of seniors and not taking care of owners' bank accounts?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: As the member will obviously know, long-term care remains in the jurisdiction of provinces and territories, and there is legislation that rules them as such. As the member also knows, we have stood by Ontario and all of the other provinces and territories throughout this outbreak. The Prime Minister has been very clear\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will go back to Ms. Kwan.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: Is the minister refusing to answer the question because she agrees that profit should come before care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: I think it's unfortunate that the member is trying to place words in my mouth. What I do agree with, though, is that long-term care needs to be reformed, and I think all provinces and territories know, and all Canadians know, that we have to do a better job.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: It's simple for the minister. She can just answer the question. Is she willing to defend for-profit care for our seniors? Is she in favour of for-profit private health care too?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: What I am willing to defend is the right for all Canadians to age with safety and dignity.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: To the minister, what is the difference? Why sell out the care of our seniors? Will she commit that she will take profit out of long-term care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I think the member opposite knows that the only way to actually reform long-term care is to work with provinces and territories, in fact, all levels of government, to ensure that the people who spent their lives caring for and nurturing us can end their lives with caring and nurturing\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will go back to Ms. Kwan.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: I think the minister knows that what we need is national standards for seniors' care. The Revera long-term care homes are owned by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Since the government owns these homes, has the military been sent in there to see what's happening to seniors under their care?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, we know that it is important to work with all of the provinces and territories under whose jurisdiction it falls to protect the seniors within those care homes. That's what we've been doing since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus, and that's what we'll continue to do to protect the lives of seniors and strengthen their protection. We will, as I said, Mr. Chair, work with the provinces and territories to have a longer-term plan so that all seniors can age with dignity and safety.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: The government has a clear responsibility here. What is the government doing to ensure the standards of care in these Revera homes that they own?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as I have repeatedly said, the jurisdiction for care of long-term care homes falls within the provincial and territorial realm. However, that being said, Mr. Chair, we have been there for provinces and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus, and as the member opposite has clearly or likely heard the Prime Minister say, we will stand with provinces and territories as all elders have the right to age with dignity\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Kwan.\nMs. Jenny Kwan: I didn't hear an answer, Mr. Chair, so the answer is nothing, then. Do you think that the families of the seniors in these homes want to hear those excuses about jurisdictional issues? Does the minister not think that the families want to hear that the federal government is doing all it can to care for their parents?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I would remind the members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Quite frankly, I don't think that families care which level of government is responsible for caring for their elders. I think what they care about is that their elders are cared for. That's in fact what the Prime Minister believes. That's in fact what our government believes, and that's why we have willingly stepped up to say to provinces and territories that we will be there with you to make sure that all seniors in our lives have the right to age with dignity and care.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now give the floor to Mrs.Gill, from the riding of Manicouagan. Go ahead, Mrs.Gill.\nMrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ): Mr.Chair, my question is for the Prime Minister who, earlier, clearly told us that the government's assistance is intended for those who are most in need and most vulnerable. I come from a riding where a lot of people make their living from the tourism industry. I don't know if the PrimeMinister read the newspapers yesterday, but in Quebec, losses to the tune of $4billion are expected until March2021 in the tourism accommodation sector alone. The service sector will lose 93,000jobs. How can I justify to my constituents the fact that a political party, which does not need it, has already seen money from the emergency wage subsidy, when people in my riding don't yet have access to it because of the seasonal nature of their work? These people haven't seen the money that is available through these programs.\nHon. Bill Morneau: We think it is very important to protect the country's employees in all sectors of the economy. Through this approach, there will be more jobs after the pandemic, and the economic situation will be better. We will continue this approach.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, this is the wrong approach. They are saying that they are protecting the jobs of the Liberal Party of Canada, which does not need the money. I'll ask a question similar to the previous one. Fishers in my riding did not qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. Another program was created for them, which isn't quite the same and doesn't really meet their needs. A government whose political wingnot the parliamentary wingdoesn't really need money takes money from the fund, but leaves fishers to make do with less generous programs that don't meet their needs. What do I tell the fishers in my riding?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that many sectors of the economy across the country are facing challenges. That's why we have adopted an approach with consistent criteria for all employees in all sectors. We have also introduced specific measures to help certain sectors, such as the fishing industry. We will continue our approach because we believe it's the best way to protect employees and our economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I'm still not satisfied. The government is saying that the best way to proceed is to give money to the political wing of the Liberal Party of Canada, when there are people who are getting nothing. What am I supposed to tell seasonal workers, who have absolutely no assurances for their future? I can't go back to my riding and say I'm proud of the work the government is doing or our efforts in the House. It's true, the House is closed right now. I forgot. I have a very hard time accepting that the government is helping employees of the Liberal Party in preparation for the next election campaign, when communities in my region are dying because their economies revolve around a single industry. I can't tell them I'm not ashamed of what's going on as we speak.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.\nHon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?\nHon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?\nHon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?\nHon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.\nMrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?\nHon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned.",

            "context": "Introduction\nSuppose a user wants to write a sentence \u201cI will be 10 minutes late.\u201d Ideally, she would type just a few keywords such as \u201c10 minutes late\u201d and an autocomplete system would be able to infer the intended sentence (Figure FIGREF1). Existing left-to-right autocomplete systems BIBREF0, BIBREF1 can often be inefficient, as the prefix of a sentence (e.g. \u201cI will be\u201d) fails to capture the core meaning of the sentence. Besides the practical goal of building a better autocomplete system, we are interested in exploring the tradeoffs inherent to such communication schemes between the efficiency of typing keywords, accuracy of reconstruction, and interpretability of keywords.\nOne approach to learn such schemes is to collect a supervised dataset of keywords-sentence pairs as a training set, but (i) it would be expensive to collect such data from users, and (ii) a static dataset would not capture a real user's natural predilection to adapt to the system BIBREF2. Another approach is to avoid supervision and jointly learn a user-system communication scheme to directly optimize the combination of efficiency and accuracy. However, learning in this way can lead to communication schemes that are uninterpretable to humans BIBREF3, BIBREF4 (see Appendix for additional related work).\nIn this work, we propose a simple, unsupervised approach to an autocomplete system that is efficient, accurate, and interpretable. For interpretability, we restrict keywords to be subsequences of their source sentences based on the intuition that humans can infer most of the original meaning from a few keywords. We then apply multi-objective optimization approaches to directly control and achieve desirable tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy.\nWe observe that naively optimizing a linear combination of efficiency and accuracy terms is unstable and leads to suboptimal schemes. Thus, we propose a new objective which optimizes for communication efficiency under an accuracy constraint. We show this new objective is more stable and efficient than the linear objective at all accuracy levels.\nAs a proof-of-concept, we build an autocomplete system within this framework which allows a user to write sentences by specifying keywords. We empirically show that our framework produces communication schemes that are 52.16% more accurate than rule-based baselines when specifying 77.37% of sentences, and 11.73% more accurate than a naive, weighted optimization approach when specifying 53.38% of sentences. Finally, we demonstrate that humans can easily adapt to the keyword-based autocomplete system and save nearly 50% of time compared to typing a full sentence in our user study.\nApproach\nConsider a communication game in which the goal is for a user to communicate a target sequence $x= (x_1, ..., x_m)$ to a system by passing a sequence of keywords $z= (z_1, ..., z_n)$. The user generates keywords $z$ using an encoding strategy $q_{\\alpha }(z\\mid x)$, and the system attempts to guess the target sequence $x$ via a decoding strategy $p_{\\beta }(x\\mid z)$.\nA good communication scheme $(q_{\\alpha }, p_{\\beta })$ should be both efficient and accurate. Specifically, we prefer schemes that use fewer keywords (cost), and the target sentence $x$ to be reconstructed with high probability (loss) where\nBased on our assumption that humans have an intuitive sense of retaining important keywords, we restrict the set of schemes to be a (potentially noncontiguous) subsequence of the target sentence. Our hypothesis is that such subsequence schemes naturally ensure interpretability, as efficient human and machine communication schemes are both likely to involve keeping important content words.\nApproach ::: Modeling with autoencoders.\nTo learn communication schemes without supervision, we model the cooperative communication between a user and system through an encoder-decoder framework. Concretely, we model the user's encoding strategy $q_{\\alpha }(z\\mid x)$ with an encoder which encodes the target sentence $x$ into the keywords $z$ by keeping a subset of the tokens. This stochastic encoder $q_{\\alpha }(z\\mid x)$ is defined by a model which returns the probability of each token retained in the final subsequence $z$. Then, we sample from Bernoulli distributions according to these probabilities to either keep or drop the tokens independently (see Appendix for an example).\nWe model the autocomplete system's decoding strategy $p_{\\beta }(x\\mid z)$ as a probabilistic model which conditions on the keywords $z$ and returns a distribution over predictions $x$. We use a standard sequence-to-sequence model with attention and copying for the decoder, but any model architecture can be used (see Appendix for details).\nApproach ::: Multi-objective optimization.\nOur goal now is to learn encoder-decoder pairs which optimally balance the communication cost and reconstruction loss. The simplest approach to balancing efficiency and accuracy is to weight $\\mathrm {cost}(x, \\alpha )$ and $\\mathrm {loss}(x, \\alpha , \\beta )$ linearly using a weight $\\lambda $ as follows,\nwhere the expectation is taken over the population distribution of source sentences $x$, which is omitted to simplify notation. However, we observe that naively weighting and searching over $\\lambda $ is suboptimal and highly unstable\u2014even slight changes to the weighting results in degenerate schemes which keep all or none of its tokens. This instability motivates us to develop a new stable objective.\nOur main technical contribution is to draw inspiration from the multi-objective optimization literature and view the tradeoff as a sequence of constrained optimization problems, where we minimize the expected cost subject to varying expected reconstruction error constraints $\\epsilon $,\nThis greatly improves the stability of the training procedure. We empirically observe that the model initially keeps most of the tokens to meet the constraints, and slowly learns to drop uninformative words from the keywords to minimize the cost. Furthermore, $\\epsilon $ in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM6) allows us to directly control the maximum reconstruction error of resulting schemes, whereas $\\lambda $ in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM5) is not directly related to any of our desiderata.\nTo optimize the constrained objective, we consider the Lagrangian of Eq (DISPLAY_FORM6),\nMuch like the objective in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM5) we can compute unbiased gradients by replacing the expectations with their averages over random minibatches. Although gradient descent guarantees convergence on Eq (DISPLAY_FORM7) only when the objective is convex, we find that not only is the optimization stable, the resulting solution achieves better performance than the weighting approach in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM5).\nApproach ::: Optimization.\nOptimization with respect to $q_{\\alpha }(z\\mid x)$ is challenging as $z$ is discrete, and thus, we cannot differentiate $\\alpha $ through $z$ via the chain rule. Because of this, we use the stochastic REINFORCE estimate BIBREF5 as follows:\nWe perform joint updates on $(\\alpha , \\beta , \\lambda )$, where $\\beta $ and $\\lambda $ are updated via standard gradient computations, while $\\alpha $ uses an unbiased, stochastic gradient estimate where we approximate the expectation in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM9). We use a single sample from $q_{\\alpha }(z\\mid x)$ and moving-average of rewards as a baseline to reduce variance.\nExperiments\nWe evaluate our approach by training an autocomplete system on 500K randomly sampled sentences from Yelp reviews BIBREF6 (see Appendix for details). We quantify the efficiency of a communication scheme $(q_{\\alpha },p_{\\beta })$ by the retention rate of tokens, which is measured as the fraction of tokens that are kept in the keywords. The accuracy of a scheme is measured as the fraction of sentences generated by greedily decoding the model that exactly matches the target sentence.\nExperiments ::: Effectiveness of constrained objective.\nWe first show that the linear objective in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM5) is suboptimal compared to the constrained objective in Eq (DISPLAY_FORM6). Figure FIGREF10 compares the achievable accuracy and efficiency tradeoffs for the two objectives, which shows that the constrained objective results in more efficient schemes than the linear objective at every accuracy level (e.g. 11.73% more accurate at a 53.38% retention rate).\nWe also observe that the linear objective is highly unstable as a function of the tradeoff parameter $\\lambda $ and requires careful tuning. Even slight changes to $\\lambda $ results in degenerate schemes that keep all or none of the tokens (e.g. $\\lambda \\le 4.2$ and $\\lambda \\ge 4.4$). On the other hand, the constrained objective is substantially more stable as a function of $\\epsilon $ (e.g. points for $\\epsilon $ are more evenly spaced than $\\lambda $).\nExperiments ::: Efficiency-accuracy tradeoff.\nWe quantify the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff compared to two rule-based baselines: Unif and Stopword. The Unif encoder randomly keeps tokens to generate keywords with the probability $\\delta $. The Stopword encoder keeps all tokens but drops stop words (e.g. `the', `a', `or') all the time ($\\delta =0$) or half of the time ($\\delta =0.5$). The corresponding decoders for these encoders are optimized using gradient descent to minimize the reconstruction error (i.e. $\\mathrm {loss}(x, \\alpha , \\beta )$).\nFigure FIGREF10 shows that two baselines achieve similar tradeoff curves, while the constrained model achieves a substantial 52.16% improvement in accuracy at a 77.37% retention rate compared to Unif, thereby showing the benefits of jointly training the encoder and decoder.\nExperiments ::: Robustness and analysis.\nWe provide additional experimental results on the robustness of learned communication schemes as well as in-depth analysis on the correlation between the retention rates of tokens and their properties, which we defer to Appendix and for space.\nExperiments ::: User study.\nWe recruited 100 crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and measured completion times and accuracies for typing randomly sampled sentences from the Yelp corpus. Each user was shown alternating autocomplete and writing tasks across 50 sentences (see Appendix for user interface). For the autocomplete task, we gave users a target sentence and asked them to type a set of keywords into the system. The users were shown the top three suggestions from the autocomplete system, and were asked to mark whether each of these three suggestions was semantically equivalent to the target sentence. For the writing task, we gave users a target sentence and asked them to either type the sentence verbatim or a sentence that preserves the meaning of the target sentence.\nTable TABREF13 shows two examples of the autocomplete task and actual user-provided keywords. Each column contains a set of keywords and its corresponding top three suggestions generated by the autocomplete system with beam search. We observe that the system is likely to propose generic sentences for under-specified keywords (left column) and almost the same sentences for over-specified keywords (right column). For properly specified keywords (middle column), the system completes sentences accordingly by adding a verb, adverb, adjective, preposition, capitalization, and punctuation.\nOverall, the autocomplete system achieved high accuracy in reconstructing the keywords. Users marked the top suggestion from the autocomplete system to be semantically equivalent to the target $80.6$% of the time, and one of the top 3 was semantically equivalent $90.11$% of the time. The model also achieved a high exact match accuracy of 18.39%. Furthermore, the system was efficient, as users spent $3.86$ seconds typing keywords compared to $5.76$ seconds for full sentences on average. The variance of the typing time was $0.08$ second for keywords and $0.12$ second for full sentences, indicating that choosing and typing keywords for the system did not incur much overhead.\nExperiments ::: Acknowledgments\nWe thank the reviewers and Yunseok Jang for their insightful comments.

            "context": "Introduction\nText simplification aims to reduce the lexical and structural complexity of a text, while still retaining the semantic meaning, which can help children, non-native speakers, and people with cognitive disabilities, to understand text better. One of the methods of automatic text simplification can be generally divided into three categories: lexical simplification (LS) BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , rule-based BIBREF2 , and machine translation (MT) BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . LS is mainly used to simplify text by substituting infrequent and difficult words with frequent and easier words. However, there are several challenges for the LS approach: a great number of transformation rules are required for reasonable coverage and should be applied based on the specific context; third, the syntax and semantic meaning of the sentence is hard to retain. Rule-based approaches use hand-crafted rules for lexical and syntactic simplification, for example, substituting difficult words in a predefined vocabulary. However, such approaches need a lot of human-involvement to manually define these rules, and it is impossible to give all possible simplification rules. MT-based approach has attracted great attention in the last several years, which addresses text simplification as a monolingual machine translation problem translating from 'ordinary' and 'simplified' sentences.\nIn recent years, neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a newly-proposed deep learning approach and achieves very impressive results BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . Unlike the traditional phrased-based machine translation system which operates on small components separately, NMT system is being trained end-to-end, without the need to have external decoders, language models or phrase tables. Therefore, the existing architectures in NMT are used for text simplification BIBREF8 , BIBREF4 . However, most recent work using NMT is limited to the training data that are scarce and expensive to build. Language models trained on simplified corpora have played a central role in statistical text simplification BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . One main reason is the amount of available simplified corpora typically far exceeds the amount of parallel data. The performance of models can be typically improved when trained on more data. Therefore, we expect simplified corpora to be especially helpful for NMT models.\nIn contrast to previous work, which uses the existing NMT models, we explore strategy to include simplified training corpora in the training process without changing the neural network architecture. We first propose to pair simplified training sentences with synthetic ordinary sentences during training, and treat this synthetic data as additional training data. We obtain synthetic ordinary sentences through back-translation, i.e. an automatic translation of the simplified sentence into the ordinary sentence BIBREF11 . Then, we mix the synthetic data into the original (simplified-ordinary) data to train NMT model. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that we can improve the text simplification quality of NMT models by mixing simplified sentences into the training set over NMT model only using the original training data.\nRelated Work\nAutomatic TS is a complicated natural language processing (NLP) task, which consists of lexical and syntactic simplification levels BIBREF12 . It has attracted much attention recently as it could make texts more accessible to wider audiences, and used as a pre-processing step, improve performances of various NLP tasks and systems BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . Usually, hand-crafted, supervised, and unsupervised methods based on resources like English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia (EW-SEW) BIBREF10 are utilized for extracting simplification rules. It is very easy to mix up the automatic TS task and the automatic summarization task BIBREF3 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF6 . TS is different from text summarization as the focus of text summarization is to reduce the length and redundant content.\nAt the lexical level, lexical simplification systems often substitute difficult words using more common words, which only require a large corpus of regular text to obtain word embeddings to get words similar to the complex word BIBREF1 , BIBREF9 . Biran et al. BIBREF0 adopted an unsupervised method for learning pairs of complex and simpler synonyms from a corpus consisting of Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia. At the sentence level, a sentence simplification model was proposed by tree transformation based on statistical machine translation (SMT) BIBREF3 . Woodsend and Lapata BIBREF17 presented a data-driven model based on a quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. Wubben et al. BIBREF18 proposed a phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) model that is trained on ordinary-simplified sentence pairs. Xu et al. BIBREF19 proposed a syntax-based machine translation model using simplification-specific objective functions and features to encourage simpler output.\nCompared with SMT, neural machine translation (NMT) has shown to produce state-of-the-art results BIBREF5 , BIBREF7 . The central approach of NMT is an encoder-decoder architecture implemented by recurrent neural networks, which can represent the input sequence as a vector, and then decode that vector into an output sequence. Therefore, NMT models were used for text simplification task, and achieved good results BIBREF8 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF20 . The main limitation of the aforementioned NMT models for text simplification depended on the parallel ordinary-simplified sentence pairs. Because ordinary-simplified sentence pairs are expensive and time-consuming to build, the available largest data is EW-SEW that only have 296,402 sentence pairs. The dataset is insufficiency for NMT model if we want to NMT model can obtain the best parameters. Considering simplified data plays an important role in boosting fluency for phrase-based text simplification, and we investigate the use of simplified data for text simplification. We are the first to show that we can effectively adapt neural translation models for text simplifiation with simplified corpora.\nSimplified Corpora\nWe collected a simplified dataset from Simple English Wikipedia that are freely available, which has been previously used for many text simplification methods BIBREF0 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF3 . The simple English Wikipedia is pretty easy to understand than normal English Wikipedia. We downloaded all articles from Simple English Wikipedia. For these articles, we removed stubs, navigation pages and any article that consisted of a single sentence. We then split them into sentences with the Stanford CorNLP BIBREF21 , and deleted these sentences whose number of words are smaller than 10 or large than 40. After removing repeated sentences, we chose 600K sentences as the simplified data with 11.6M words, and the size of vocabulary is 82K.\nText Simplification using Neural Machine Translation\nOur work is built on attention-based NMT BIBREF5 as an encoder-decoder network with recurrent neural networks (RNN), which simultaneously conducts dynamic alignment and generation of the target simplified sentence.\nThe encoder uses a bidirectional RNN that consists of forward and backward RNN. Given a source sentence INLINEFORM0 , the forward RNN and backward RNN calculate forward hidden states INLINEFORM1 and backward hidden states INLINEFORM2 , respectively. The annotation vector INLINEFORM3 is obtained by concatenating INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 .\nThe decoder is a RNN that predicts a target simplificated sentence with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) BIBREF22 . Given the previously generated target (simplified) sentence INLINEFORM0 , the probability of next target word INLINEFORM1 is DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is a non-linear function, INLINEFORM1 is the embedding of INLINEFORM2 , and INLINEFORM3 is a decoding state for time step INLINEFORM4 .\nState INLINEFORM0 is calculated by DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the activation function GRU.\nThe INLINEFORM0 is the context vector computed as a weighted annotation INLINEFORM1 , computed by DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere the weight INLINEFORM0 is computed by DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 are weight matrices. The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of the training data. Beam search is employed for decoding.\nSynthetic Simplified Sentences\nWe train an auxiliary system using NMT model from the simplified sentence to the ordinary sentence, which is first trained on the available parallel data. For leveraging simplified sentences to improve the quality of NMT model for text simplification, we propose to adapt the back-translation approach proposed by Sennrich et al. BIBREF11 to our scenario. More concretely, Given one sentence in simplified sentences, we use the simplified-ordinary system in translate mode with greedy decoding to translate it to the ordinary sentences, which is denoted as back-translation. This way, we obtain a synthetic parallel simplified-ordinary sentences. Both the synthetic sentences and the available parallel data are used as training data for the original NMT system.\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate the performance of text simplification using neural machine translation on available parallel sentences and additional simplified sentences.\nDataset. We use two simplification datasets (WikiSmall and WikiLarge). WikiSmall consists of ordinary and simplified sentences from the ordinary and simple English Wikipedias, which has been used as benchmark for evaluating text simplification BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF8 . The training set has 89,042 sentence pairs, and the test set has 100 pairs. WikiLarge is also from Wikipedia corpus whose training set contains 296,402 sentence pairs BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 . WikiLarge includes 8 (reference) simplifications for 2,359 sentences split into 2,000 for development and 359 for testing.\nMetrics. Three metrics in text simplification are chosen in this paper. BLEU BIBREF5 is one traditional machine translation metric to assess the degree to which translated simplifications differed from reference simplifications. FKGL measures the readability of the output BIBREF23 . A small FKGL represents simpler output. SARI is a recent text-simplification metric by comparing the output against the source and reference simplifications BIBREF20 .\nWe evaluate the output of all systems using human evaluation. The metric is denoted as Simplicity BIBREF8 . The three non-native fluent English speakers are shown reference sentences and output sentences. They are asked whether the output sentence is much simpler (+2), somewhat simpler (+1), equally (0), somewhat more difficult (-1), and much more difficult (-2) than the reference sentence.\nMethods. We use OpenNMT BIBREF24 as the implementation of the NMT system for all experiments BIBREF5 . We generally follow the default settings and training procedure described by Klein et al.(2017). We replace out-of-vocabulary words with a special UNK symbol. At prediction time, we replace UNK words with the highest probability score from the attention layer. OpenNMT system used on parallel data is the baseline system. To obtain a synthetic parallel training set, we back-translate a random sample of 100K sentences from the collected simplified corpora. OpenNMT used on parallel data and synthetic data is our model. The benchmarks are run on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5930K CPU@3.50GHz, 32GB Mem, trained on 1 GPU GeForce GTX 1080 (Pascal) with CUDA v. 8.0.\nWe choose three statistical text simplification systems. PBMT-R is a phrase-based method with a reranking post-processing step BIBREF18 . Hybrid performs sentence splitting and deletion operations based on discourse representation structures, and then simplifies sentences with PBMT-R BIBREF25 . SBMT-SARI BIBREF19 is syntax-based translation model using PPDB paraphrase database BIBREF26 and modifies tuning function (using SARI). We choose two neural text simplification systems. NMT is a basic attention-based encoder-decoder model which uses OpenNMT framework to train with two LSTM layers, hidden states of size 500 and 500 hidden units, SGD optimizer, and a dropout rate of 0.3 BIBREF8 . Dress is an encoder-decoder model coupled with a deep reinforcement learning framework, and the parameters are chosen according to the original paper BIBREF20 . For the experiments with synthetic parallel data, we back-translate a random sample of 60 000 sentences from the collected simplified sentences into ordinary sentences. Our model is trained on synthetic data and the available parallel data, denoted as NMT+synthetic.\nResults. Table 1 shows the results of all models on WikiLarge dataset. We can see that our method (NMT+synthetic) can obtain higher BLEU, lower FKGL and high SARI compared with other models, except Dress on FKGL and SBMT-SARI on SARI. It verified that including synthetic data during training is very effective, and yields an improvement over our baseline NMF by 2.11 BLEU, 1.7 FKGL and 1.07 SARI. We also substantially outperform Dress, who previously reported SOTA result. The results of our human evaluation using Simplicity are also presented in Table 1. NMT on synthetic data is significantly better than PBMT-R, Dress, and SBMT-SARI on Simplicity. It indicates that our method with simplified data is effective at creating simpler output.\nResults on WikiSmall dataset are shown in Table 2. We see substantial improvements (6.37 BLEU) than NMT from adding simplified training data with synthetic ordinary sentences. Compared with statistical machine translation models (PBMT-R, Hybrid, SBMT-SARI), our method (NMT+synthetic) still have better results, but slightly worse FKGL and SARI. Similar to the results in WikiLarge, the results of our human evaluation using Simplicity outperforms the other models. In conclusion, Our method produces better results comparing with the baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of adding simplified training data.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose one simple method to use simplified corpora during training of NMT systems, with no changes to the network architecture. In the experiments on two datasets, we achieve substantial gains in all tasks, and new SOTA results, via back-translation of simplified sentences into the ordinary sentences, and treating this synthetic data as additional training data. Because we do not change the neural network architecture to integrate simplified corpora, our method can be easily applied to other Neural Text Simplification (NTS) systems. We expect that the effectiveness of our method not only varies with the quality of the NTS system used for back-translation, but also depends on the amount of available parallel and simplified corpora. In the paper, we have only utilized data from Wikipedia for simplified sentences. In the future, many other text sources are available and the impact of not only size, but also of domain should be investigated.",
